<h3>TO OUR READERS.</h3>

<p>The College of Pharmacy was founded with a view to the elevation
of the professional standing and scientific attainments of Apothecaries,
as well as to guard their material interests by raising a barrier against
ignorance and imposture. What they have accomplished and how far they
have been successful it does not become the Board of Trustees to state; if
the results have not, in all respects, been what might be desired, it has not
arisen from want of earnest effort and honest intention on their part. As
a further means of benefiting their profession, of keeping its members
acquainted with the progress it is making at home and abroad, and of
inspiring among them a spirit of scientific inquiry, they believe that the
establishment of a Journal, devoted to the pursuits and the interests of
Apothecaries, would be of the highest utility.</p></div><!--chapter-->

<p>By far the wealthiest and most populous city in the Union, New York,
with its environs, contains several hundred Apothecaries, among whom are
many of great experience and eminent ability; it contains numerous Laboratories
where chemicals are manufactured on a large scale, and where the
appliances and refinements of modern science are compelled into the
service of commerce; it contains within itself all the means of scientific
progress, and yet these means lie, for the most part, waste and idle; the
observations that are made and the processes that are invented profit only
the observer and the inventor. Both they and their consequences—for
even apparently trivial observations may contain in themselves the germ
of important discoveries, and no man can tell what fruit they may produce
in the minds of others—are lost to the world.</p>

<p>New York is the commercial centre of the Union, the point to which
our products are brought for exportation, and from
which various goods, <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
obtained from abroad, are distributed to the remainder of the United
States. It is the chief drug mart of the Union; the source from which
the largest part of our country draws its supplies of all medicines that
are not the products of their own immediate vicinities. It is thus connected
more intimately with the Druggists of a large portion of our country
than any other city; many visit it annually or oftener; most have business
relations with it. Is the spirit of trade incompatible with that of science?
Is money-getting to absorb all our faculties to the exclusion of anything
nobler or higher? Are we ever to remain merely the commercial metropolis
of our Union, but to permit science and art to centre in more congenial
and less busy abodes? Shall we not rather attempt to profit by our
many advantages, to use the facilities thrown in our way by the channels
of trade for the diffusion of scientific knowledge, and in return avail ourselves
of the information which may flow into us from the interior?</p>

<p>But it is not alone, we hope, by the information it would impart that a
Journal such as is contemplated would be useful. A higher and no less
useful object would be that it would excite a spirit of inquiry and emulation
among the profession itself; it would encourage observation and experiment;
it would train our young men to more exact habits of scientific
inquiry. In diffusing information it would create it, and would be doubly
happy in being the means of making discoveries it was intended to promulgate.</p>

<p>Such are the views which have determined the Trustees of the College
to publish a Journal of Pharmacy. It will appear on the first day of
every month, each number containing thirty-two octavo pages. It will be
devoted exclusively to the interests and pursuits of the Druggist and
Apothecary. While it is hoped that its pages will present everything
that is important relating to the scientific progress of Pharmacy, it is
intended to be mainly practical in its character, subserving the daily wants
of the Apothecary, and presenting, as far as possible, that kind of information
which can be turned to immediate account, whether it relates to
new drugs and formulæ, or improved processes, manipulations, and apparatus.
Such are the aims and ends of the New York Journal of Pharmacy;
and the Druggists of New York are more particularly appealed to to sustain
it, not only by their subscriptions, but by contributions from their pens.
This last, indeed, is urgently pressed upon them; for, unless it receives
such aid, however successful otherwise, it will fail in one great object for
which it was originated. When special information
is wanted on any <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
particular subject, the conductors of the Journal, if in their power, will
always be happy to afford it.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>It is no part of the intention of the College to derive an income from
the Journal. As soon as the state of the subscription list warrants it, it is
intended to increase its size so that each number shall contain forty-eight
instead of thirty-two pages.</p>

<h3>REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF COLLEGE OF
PHARMACY AS AMENDED.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The Committee to whom was referred the subject of the establishment
of a Journal of Pharmacy in the city of New York, have given their
attention to the subject, and beg leave to report as follows:</p>

<p>1. That in their opinion it is all important that a Journal of Pharmacy
should be established in this city as soon as practicable, for reasons well
known, and therefore unnecessary here to enumerate.</p>

<p>2. They recommend that the first number of a Journal of thirty-two
octavo pages be issued on the 1st day of January next, and one number
each month thereafter, to be called the New York Journal of Pharmacy.</p>

<p>3. The general control of the Journal shall be vested in a committee
of five, which shall review every article intended for publication, four of
whom shall be elected annually by the Board of Trustees at the first
stated meeting succeeding the annual election of officers; and a committee
of the same number shall be now elected, who shall act until the next
annual election, to be denominated the Publishing Committee. The
President of the College of Pharmacy shall be “ex officio” a member of
this Committee, and the whole number of this Committee shall be five,
two of whom may act.</p>

<p>4. That an Editor be appointed by the Publishing Committee who
shall attend to all the duties of its publication, and cause to be prepared
all articles for the Journal, and to have the entire management of it under
the control and direction of the Publishing Committee.</p>

<p>5. The compensation for the services of the Editor, together with all
financial matters connected with the Journal, shall be subject to the control
of the Publishing Committee. <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span></p>

<p>6. The matter to be published in the Journal shall be original communications,
extracts from foreign and domestic journals, and editorials.
No matter shall be published except what may relate directly
or indirectly to the subject of Pharmacy, and the legitimate business of
Druggists and Apothecaries. No advertisements of nostrums shall be
admitted.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>7. The subscription list shall be kept in the hands of the Publishers,
subject to the disposal of the Publishing Committee.</p>

<h3>ON TWO VARIETIES OF FALSE JALAP.
<span class="hsmall">BY JOHN H. CURRIE.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Two different roots have for some time back been brought to the New
York market, for the purpose of adulterating or counterfeiting the various
preparations of Jalap. They differ materially from the Mechoacan and
other varieties of false Jalap which formerly existed in our markets, as
described by Wood and Bache in the United States Dispensatory, while
some of the pieces bear no slight resemblance to the true root. The
specimens I have been able to procure are so imperfect, and so altered by
the process of drying, that the botanists I have consulted are unable to give
any information even as to the order to which they belong. I have not
been able either to trace their commercial history, nor do I know how,
under the present able ad­min­i­stra­tion of the law for the inspection of drugs,
they have obtained admission to our port. The article
or articles, since <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
there are at least two of them, come done up in bales like those of the
true Jalap, and are probably brought from the same port, Vera Cruz.</p>

<p>No. 1 appears to be the rhizome or underground stem of an exogenous
perennial herb, throwing up at one end each year one or more shoots,
which after flowering die down to the ground. It comes in pieces varying
in length from two to five inches, and in thickness from the third of an
inch to three inches. In some of the pieces the root has apparently
been split or cut lengthwise; in others, particularly in the large pieces,
it has been sliced transversely like Colombo root. The pieces are somewhat
twisted or contorted, corrugated longitudinally and externally, varying
in color from a yellowish to a dark brown. The transverse sections
appear as if the rhizome may have been broken in pieces at nodes from two
to four inches distant from each other, and at which the stem was enlarged.
Or the same appearance may have been caused by the rhizome having been
cut into sections of various length; and the resinous juice exuding on
the cut surfaces, has hindered them from contracting to the same extent
as the intervening part of the root. On the cut or broken surfaces are seen
concentric circles of woody fibres, the intervening parenchyma being contracted
and depressed. The fresh broken surfaces of these pieces exhibit
in a marked manner the concentric layers of woody fibres. The pieces
that are cut longitudinally, on the other hand, are heavier than those just
described, though their specific gravity is still not near so great as that of
genuine Jalap. Their fracture is more uniform, of a greyish brown color,
and highly resinous.</p>

<p>This variety of false Jalap, when exhausted with alcohol, the tincture
thus obtained evaporated, and the residuum washed with water, yielded from
<span class="nowrap">9&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
to <span class="nowrap">15&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
per cent. of resin, the average of ten experiments being 13 per
cent. Its appearance was strikingly like that of Jalap resin. It had a
slightly sweetish mucilaginous taste, leaving a little acridity, and the odor
was faintly jalapine. It resembled Jalap resin in being slowly soluble in
concentrated sulphuric acid, but unlike Jalap resin it was wholly soluble in
ether. In a dose of ten grains it proved feebly purgative, causing two or
three moderate liquid stools. Its operation was unattended with griping
or other unpleasant effect, except a slight feeling of nausea felt about half
an hour after the extract had been swallowed, and continuing for some
time.</p>

<p>This variety of false Jalap is probably used, when ground, for the purpose
of mixing with and adulterating the powder of true Jalap,
or is sold <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
for it, or for the purpose of obtaining from it its resin or extract, which is
sold as genuine resin or extract of Jalap. The powder strikingly resembles
that of true Jalap, has a faint odor of Jalap, but is destitute, to a great
extent, of its flavor. The dust, too, arising from it, is much less irritating
to the air passages.</p>

<p>The second variety is a tuber possibly of an orchidate plant, a good
deal resembling in shape, color and size, a butternut, (Juglans cinerea.)
Externally it is black or nearly so, in some places shining as if varnished
by some resinous exudation, but generally dull, marked by deep longitudinal
cuts extending almost to the centre of the tubers; internally it is
yellow or yellowish white, having a somewhat horny fracture, and marked
in its transverse sections with dots as if from sparse, delicate fibres. When
first imported the root is comparatively soft, but becomes dry and brittle
by keeping. Its odor resembles that of Jalap, and its taste is nauseous,
sweetish, and mucilaginous.</p>

<p>This root contains no resin whatever. Treated with boiling water it
yields a large amount (75 per cent.) of extract. This is soluble, to a great
extent, likewise in alcohol. With iodine no blue color is produced.</p>

<p>The extract obtained from this drug appears, in ordinary doses, perfectly
inert, five or ten grains producing, when swallowed, no effect whatever.
Is this root employed for the purpose of obtaining its extract, and
is this latter sold as genuine extract of Jalap?</p>

<p>Of the effect which frauds of this kind cannot fail to have on the practice
of medicine it does not fall within my province to speak, but commercially
its working is sufficiently obvious. One hundred pounds of
Jalap at the market price, 60 cents per pound, will cost $60. In extracting
this there will be employed about $5 worth of alcohol, making in all
$65. There will be obtained forty pounds of extract, costing thus $1
<span class="nowrap">62&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
per pound.</p>

<p>One hundred pounds of false Jalap, No. 1, may be obtained for $20;
admitting the alcohol to cost $5, it will make in all $25. This will produce
thirty-six pounds of extract, costing rather less than 70 cents per
pound.</p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>One hundred pounds of variety No. 2 may be had for $20, and no
alcohol is necessary in obtaining the extract. The yield being seventy-five
pounds, the extract will cost rather less than twenty-seven
cents per pound.</p>

<h3>VIRGIN SCAMMONY,
<span class="hsmall">WITH SOME RE­MARKS UPON THE
CHAR­AC­TER­IS­TICS OF
SCAM­MO­NY RE­SIN.</span>
<span class="hsmall">BY B. W. BULL.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The more extended use in medicine which this substance has acquired
within a few years, and its consequent greater consumption, render the
knowledge of its peculiarities and the modes of ascertaining its purity
doubly important to the druggist and apothecary.</p>

<p>An instance occurred a few weeks since, showing the necessity of careful
and thorough examination of every parcel of this drug, and possessing
some interest, from the fact that no description of any similar attempt at
falsification has, I believe, been before published.</p>

<p>The commercial house with which I am connected, purchased a parcel
of what purported to be virgin scammony from the importer, who
obtained it direct from Smyrna. A sample of it was examined and
found to contain seventy per cent. of resinous matter, but when the whole
lot was received, it was found to consist evidently of two different grades
of the article.</p>

<p>The whole of it was composed of amorphous pieces, possessing externally
a similar appearance. Upon breaking them, however, a manifest
difference was observable. Some of the pieces possessed the resinous
fracture, and the other char­ac­ter­is­tics of virgin scammony, while the
remainder, which constituted about five eighths of the whole, exposed a
dull, non-resinous surface when freshly broken.</p>

<p>I selected two samples, each possessing in the highest degree the char­ac­ter­is­tics
of the two varieties, and subjected them to the action of sulphuric
ether with the following results, designating the resinous or best
No. 1, and the other specimen No. 2:―</p>

<p>The vegetable substance in No. 2 was principally, if not entirely, farinaceous
or starchy matter, of which the other contained not a trace.
The result shows that this parcel of scammony was composed partly of
true virgin scammony mixed with that of an inferior quality; and also
indicates the necessity of examining the whole of every parcel, and of not
trusting to the favorable result of the examination of a mere sample.</p>

<p>The powder in the two specimens was very similar in shade, and they
possessed in about the same degree the odor peculiar to the substance,
showing the fallacy of relying upon this as a means of judging of the
comparative goodness of different samples. This fact may appear anomalous,
but on different occasions the powder of No. 2 was selected as having
the most decided scammony odor.</p>

<p>Since examining the above, I have had an opportunity of experimenting
upon a portion of scammony imported from Trieste as the true
Aleppo scammony, of which there are exported from Aleppo not more
than from two hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds annually.</p>

<p>The parcel consisted of a sample of one pound only, which was
obtained from a druggist of respectability in that place by one of my
partners, who was assured that the sample in question was from the
above source, and the kind above alluded to. This scammony was in
somewhat flattish pieces, covered externally with a thin coating of chalk
in which it had been rolled, the structure was uniformly compact, the
color of the fracture greenish, and it possessed in a high degree the caseous
odor.</p>

<p>The fracture was unusually sensitive to the action of moisture. By
merely breathing upon a freshly exposed surface, a film resembling the
bloom upon fruit was at once perceived. Its specific gravity was 1,209,
which, it will be observed, approximates with unusual accuracy to that
given by Pereira as the specific gravity of true scammony, viz. 1,210. It
contained―</p>

<p>There was no starchy matter present in the portion examined.</p>

<p>The mode of deciding upon the value or goodness of different samples

ether, has seemed to me productive of a negative
result in showing <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
how much non-resinous matter was present, rather than a certain

but some experiments upon the resinous residuum lead to a more favorable

<p>The resin analysed by Johnston was obtained by evaporating the
alcoholic solution, and he describes it as opaque, pale yellow, hard, and
brittle; when obtained, however, by evaporating the ethereal solution I
have found it transparent.</p>

<p>It might be inferred that, with a composition so different from that of
the substances above adduced, its behavior with re-agents would be different
from theirs; and its action with strong acids confirms the supposition,
as may be seen by reference to the appended papers from a late number
of the Paris Journal of Pharmacy.</p>

<p>The Edinburgh Pharmacopœia has an extract of scammony among its
officinal preparations, prepared by treating scammony with proof spirit,
and evaporating the solution. It is described as of a dirty greenish
brown color. This color, however, is not a necessary accompaniment, but
is owing either to some coloring matter being dissolved in the menstruum
or to the partial oxydation of the dissolved substance under the influence
of the air and the heat of the operation.</p>

<p>The ethereal solution of scammony resin, when gradually evaporated,
and without exposure to heat, leaves a colorless or amber-colored resin,
perfectly transparent and soluble in alcohol; when
heated, however, <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
during the operation, more or less insoluble matter of a dark color is found.
Sometimes the ethereal solution, when spontaneously evaporated, leaves a
dark residuum, but a second solution and evaporation leave it as above
described.</p>

<p>This product, obtained from several different parcels of virgin scammony,
I have considered free from admixture with any of the substances
with which scammony is said to be adulterated, and from the similarity of
their behavior, and, as the circumstances under which the sample from
Trieste above alluded to was obtained are such as to make its genuineness
very certain, feel warranted in so doing.</p>

<p>Sulphuric acid does not immediately decompose it, but produces the
effect described by M. Thorel.</p>

<p>Nitric acid produces no discoloration, nor does hydrochloric acid immediately.</p>

<p>If scammony should be adulterated with colophony, sulphuric acid
would be a very ready method of detection, though it would seem that
this substance would hardly be resorted to, unless an entirely new mode
of sophisticating the article should be adopted abroad.</p>

<p>The introduction of farinaceous substances and chalk is effected while
the scammony is in a soft condition, in which state it would be difficult to
incorporate colophony completely with the mass.</p>

<p>An admixture of resin of guaiac is also detected by the same agent, a
fact which seems to have escaped observation.</p>

<p>When brought in contact with sulphuric acid, resin of guaiac immediately
assumes a deep crimson hue, and this reaction is so distinct that a
proportion of not more than four or five per cent. is readily detected.</p>

<p>The deep red mixture of sulphuric acid with resin of guaiac becomes
green when diluted with water, a remarkable change, which adds to the
efficacy of the test. Scammony resin, on the contrary, suffers no alteration
by dilution.</p>

<p>In addition, nitric acid affords a ready mode of ascertaining the presence
of resin of guaiac. It is well known that nitric acid, when mixed with
an alcoholic solution of guaiac, causes a deep green color, which soon
passes into brown, or if the solution is dilute, into yellow.</p>

<p>This reaction is manifest when scammony resin is mixed with guaiac
resin in the proportion above mentioned, though the greenish blue tinge is
then very transient, and sometimes not readily perceived.</p>

<p>Chloride of soda is a delicate test for the presence
of guaiac resin. <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
Added to an alcoholic solution, a beautiful green color appears, while it
produces no effect on scammony resin. This reaction is very evident, though
transient, when a very small proportion of guaiac is present. Nitrate of
silver causes a blue color in a solution of guaiac resin, as does also sesqui-chloride
of iron, neither of which agents affects the color of a solution of
scammony resin. In fact, the evidences of the presence of guaiac are so
numerous and distinct that there can be no possibility of an undetected
adulteration with this substance.</p>

<p>The high price of resin of jalap would seem to be sufficient to prevent
its being resorted to as a means of sophisticating scammony; but in case
this substance should be made use of, the method proposed for detecting
it by means of ether is defective, since, according to authorities, resin of
jalap is partially soluble in that substance.</p>

<p>It becomes of interest to know whether in the preparation of scammony
the juice of the plant from which it is obtained is ever mixed with
that of other plants of similar properties, or with that of plants destitute
of efficacy. This information can, of course, only be furnished by those
familiar with the localities and with the mode of its preparation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><a class="aftntanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanch1">1</a>“In
advancing the opinion that scammony should only be employed for
therapeutic purposes in the state of resin, I mean that this resin should
only be prepared by the apothecary himself. When, however, it is
impossible for the apothecary to do so, and the commercial article is in consequence
resorted to, there arises a liability to deception. We must then
be enabled to recognise its purity.</p>

<p>To avoid detection of the fraud, the admixture must either be in small
quantity, or it must possess nearly the same action. In this latter case,
resin of jalap would be employed as being less in price and nearly as
active.</p>

<p>The method I propose for detecting an adulteration of this nature, in
case it should be attempted, is based on the one side upon the entire
insolubility of resin of jalap in rectified sulphuric ether, and on the other,
upon the solubility of scammony resin in this liquid. Nothing is easier
than the detection of a mixture of these two resins, since eight grammes
of ether dissolve completely ten centigrammes
of scammony resin. <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span></p>

<p>Thus by agitating for a short time a mixture of twenty centigrammes
of suspected resin with sixteen grammes of sulphuric ether, we shall be
certain of the presence of resin of jalap, provided there is no other admixture,
if a portion remains undissolved. This undissolved portion, dried
and weighed, gives the proportion of the two resins.</p>

<p>Other more culpable sophistications may be attempted, either by the
addition of resin of guaiac, or by that of colophony or other substances.</p>

<p>The resin of guaiac may easily be detected by means of the solution of
gum, which I have specified as one of the most certain re-agents (Repertoire
du Pharmacien, vol. iv., 1848), or by the means of nitrous gas, or
bichloride of mercury.</p>

<p>Many re-agents disclose the presence of common resin or of pitch in
the resin of scammony. First, spirits of turpentine, which dissolves the
common resin at the ordinary temperature, and which leaves scammony
resin almost untouched. The most certain re-agent, however, in my opinion,
is sulphuric acid. This acid possesses the property of dissolving
many resins—modifying their composition more or less.</p>

<p>Thus, if a small quantity is poured on common resin, an intense red
color is produced by contact; poured on scammony resin, on the contrary,
it does not produce an immediate change; only after some minutes,
and with exposure to the air, does it become colored, and then but feebly,
with the production of a color resembling the lees of wine, while in the
first case the color is a very deep scarlet.</p>

<p>By this method one twentieth part of colophony may be detected in
scammony resin. It is sufficient to pour upon twenty-five or thirty centigrammes
of resin, placed in a glass or porcelain mortar, four or five
grammes of commercial sulphuric acid, and to give one or two turns of
the pestle; if colophony is present, the mixture will redden immediately
upon contact; if, on the contrary, it is pure, the liquid will only become
colored after the lapse of some time.</p>

<p>Colophony being more soluble in sulphuric acid is acted upon with
more rapidity.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><a class="aftntanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanch2">2</a>“Scammony
resin obtained by alcohol of 86 degrees occurs in form of
powder or in thin transparent scales, if the alcoholic solution has been
evaporated on a stove upon plates, or upon
sheets of tin. <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span></p>

<p>It is characterized by the peculiar odor of the substance from which it is
obtained, the <i>odeur de brioche</i>, or of rancid butter.</p>

<p>If scammony resin has been mixed with one twentieth of common
resin, trituration in a mortar developes the odor of the latter to a sufficient
degree to cause detection of the fraud. Heated in a tube, a peculiar
odor manifests itself with sufficient distinctness to indicate its purity.</p>

<p>This pure resin is soluble in all proportions in ether of 56 degrees (·752).
This property affords a means of purifying it, by means of which it is
obtained in thin flakes, by exposure to the air on plates.</p>

<p>Solution of ammonia at 24 degrees (·910) dissolves scammony resin
completely. The solution has a more or less green color. These different
properties, which the resin of scammony, obtained by alcohol, possesses,
are sufficiently distinct to assist in distinguishing it from other resins or to
establish its purity.”</p>

<h3>ON THE PREPARATION OF STRAMONIUM OINTMENT. <span class="hsmall">
BY EUGENE DUPUY, PHARMACEUTIST, NEW YORK CITY.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The powerful narcotic and sedative properties of the Datura stramonium;
added to the fact of its luxuriant growth in the vacant grounds of the
inhabited districts of the United States, has made its use popular with
most of our practising physicians. Besides its use smoked as tobacco in
asthmatic cases, its properties analogous to those of hyosciamus and belladonna,
have enabled practitioners to use it with success for producing dilatation
of the pupil and in anodyne fomentations. In fact, the consequence
of its demonstrated efficient activity as a remedial agent, has prompted
its adoption in the United States Pharmacopœia, where the leaves and
seeds are recognised, and the Tincture, Extract, and Ointment are officinal.
According to our Pharmacopœia, last edition, to prepare the ointment, one
drachm of the extract of stramonium is mixed to the proportion of one ounce
of lard. Such a mixture, though possibly as effectual as need be, lacks the
green color and homogeneity to which both patients and physicians have
been accustomed. To remedy these objections, I have
found the <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
following process to give a good preparation both in quality and appearance.
I am inclined to think that the objections which have been made to the
former officinal ointment are chiefly ascribable to the difficulty of obtaining
readily an ointment which would keep one year, that is free from
water of vegetation or not impaired by a too protracted ebullition, and
consequent decomposition, which deprives it of its properties, spoiling its
appearance, and giving it an unpleasant pyrogenous odor, which shows
the extent of the alteration it has undergone, making of it an irritating
rather than a soothing unguent. In the process I now submit to the
opinion of the profession, I had in view, 1st. To obtain at all seasons an
ointment fulfilling the reasonable expectations of practitioners; 2d. Which
could be easily prepared by competent Phar­ma­ceu­tists throughout the
United States. It is as follows:</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Stramonium Leaves,</td>
 <td class="pleft">half a pound.</td></tr>

 <td class="pleft">Alcohol at 95°,</td>

<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Prepared lard,</td>
 <td class="pleft">fourteen ounces.</td></tr>
</table></div></div>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Moisten the leaves, previously reduced to a coarse powder, with sufficient
alcohol, in a tight vessel having a suitable cover; melt the lard in a
pan three times in capacity to the bulk of the lard, and stir in it gradually
the prepared stramonium; keep the mixture in a warm place for five
hours, stirring occasionally, till the alcohol has disappeared from the ointment,
which may be ascertained by placing a lighted match on the
surface of the warm ointment just stirred. Filter the mixture through
flannel, in an appropriate vessel. The stramonium ointment thus prepared
is a reliable preparation, possessed of a handsome green color, a rather
pleasant herbaceous odor, and forms a homogeneous mass containing all
the valuable constituents of the Datura stramonium, if the leaves have
been gathered while the plant is in bud, and properly preserved. For
the warm days of summer the substitution of two ounces of beeswax for
the same quantity of lard gives it the consistence which it has at the
low temperature of the remaining seasons.</p>

until a gallon of liquid shall have passed; evaporate it to twenty ounces
by means of a water bath, then add the sugar, filter, and make the addition
of the alcoholic solution of gaultheria when cold. By following this
process, I believe that a kind of saponification takes place, which allows of
the more ready solution of the active principle of the senna in the
aqueous vehicle, probably because chlorophylle being united to a dried
essential oil, participating in the properties of resins, is rendered soluble, and
the extractive portion being denuded of its resinoid covering, is more
readily extracted by the percolating liquid. I make use of a percolator
possessed of a convenient hydraulic power; it has rendered readily, within
thirty hours, a highly saturated liquid, containing in a gallon all the
soluble principles of this extract. Ordinary percolators will answer also;
but the ingredients needing to be more loosely packed, do not yield so
fully or so readily. The addition of torrefied dandelion root is intended
to give to this fluid extract some greater value on account of its peculiar
action on the hepatic system. I employ in preference the German chamomile
(Camomila vulgaris<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanch3">3</a>),
because of its pleasant aroma and its carminative
properties, joined to a bitter principle, which seems to increase
the purgative effect of the senna.</p>

<h3>ACCIDENTS CAUSED BY A VERY SMALL DOSE OF
SANTONINE GIVEN TO A CHILD.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Santonine, being a tasteless vermifuge, is easily given to children, consequently
its employment becomes daily more and more frequent; we
therefore think it useful to expose the accidents which may follow the use
of this medicine, when given in too large a dose. We refer to a case
given in the Bulletin de Thérapeutique, by Dr. Spengler (d’Herborn).
The patient, a child of four years old, who had been suffering for several
months from intestinal worms, had taken at different times, and with
success, a dose of a grain and a half. One day they gave him three
grains in two doses; after the first dose he became troubled with pains in
the epigastrium, colic, and vomiting. He had frequent stools, in which
were found a number of ascarides. Notwithstanding these numerous
evacuations, the bad symptoms continued to increase; his body became
cold, his face livid, his eyes had a blue circle round them, a cold sweat
broke out, his respiration became embarrassed, and his extremities convulsed.
Besides these symptoms, M. Spengler mentions that there were
dilatation of the pupils and great pain in the abdomen (not, however,
increased by pressure). He prescribed milk in abundance, and after
several evacuations, the potion of Rivière in an oily emulsion. The little
patient was placed in a very warm bed; during the night he was much
disturbed; the following day he took some doses of calomel, after which
several worms were evacuated, and from that time he became convalescent.
We have related this fact as a caution against the accidents which
may result from the use of santonine, although the severity of the symptoms
and the smallness of the dose may make us doubt whether the
santonine was pure, or whether some other cause might not have produced
the terrible results attributed to it.—<i>Journal de Pharmacie et

<h3>ON POISONING BY NICOTINE.
<span class="hsmall">
<i>Read before the National Academy of Medicine.</i></span>
<span class="hsmall">
BY M. ORFILA.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p><span class="smcap">G<b>ENTLEMEN,</b></span>—In laying before the Academy a memoir on Nicotine, on
the 20th of last month, I stated that I did not think I ought to read it,
fearing that it might exercise some influence on the proceedings which
were to take place at Mons, eight days afterwards. My scruples are now
entirely removed, because I was present at the three first sittings of the
Court of Assizes at Hainault, and have heard the examination of the
accused persons, and the depositions of some of the witnesses. My memoir,
supposing it to be published to-morrow, and consequently much
before the sentence will have been pronounced, will not aggravate the
situation of the accused, nor increase the power of the ministers of justice.
You will see, in fact, that after describing nicotine, I came to the conclusion,
that it may be easily detected in the digestive canal, the liver, the
lungs, and all those organs into which it has been carried after its absorption.
Now, M. de Bocarmé confesses that he prepared some nicotine, that
Gustave Fougnies took an appreciable dose of it, and died very shortly
afterwards. Consequently, he cannot dispute the fact of M. Stas having
found this alkaloid in the body of his brother-in-law. It is of little importance
to us that Madame de Bocarmé accuses her husband of being
the author of the crime, whilst he, on the other hand, attributes the death
of Gustave to a mistake of his wife’s, who might inadvertently have poured
the nicotine into a glass instead of wine. It will be for the jury to decide
what truth there is in these assertions; as scientific men, we ought to
confine ourselves in this case to the solution of the chemical and medical
problems relating to this subject.</p>

<p>I think I ought to read to the Academy the textual memoir, without
the preamble, which I composed a fortnight ago, when the principal circumstances,
which have since been developed, were but imperfectly known.</p>

<p>The principal object of this paper is to show:―</p>

<p>1. That we may characterize pure nicotine as easily as we can a poison
derived from the mineral kingdom.</p>

<p>2. That we may detect this alkali in the digestive canal, and assert its
existence there, although it is present only to the extent of
a few drops. <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span></p>

<p>3. That it is sufficiently easy to prove its presence in the liver and the
other organs, after it has been absorbed.</p>

<p>1. <i>Pure Nicotine may be characterised as easily as a Poison derived
from the Mineral Kingdom.</i>—Nicotine, discovered in 1809 by the illustrious
Vauquelin, was studied in 1828 by Messrs. Posselt and Reimann,
who found it in different species of nicotiana, in macrophylla rustica, and
glutinosa. Messrs. Boutron, Charlard, and Henry described some of its
properties in 1836. Havanna tobacco contains two per cent., that of
Maryland 2·3, that of Virginia 6·9, that of Alsace 3·2, that of Pas-de-Calais
4·9, that of the Nord 6·6, and that of Lot 8. It is classed among
the <i>natural volatile</i> vegetable alkalies, which are only three in number,
namely, <i>conicine</i>, <i>theobromine</i>, and <i>nicotine</i>. This last is entirely composed
of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen. It may be represented as a compound
of one equivalent of ammonia (H<sub>3</sub>N), and of one of a hydro-carbon containing
four equivalents of hydrogen and ten of carbon (H<sub>4</sub>C<sub>10</sub>). It is now
obtained by a much more simple process than was formerly adopted,
which consists in passing the vapor of tobacco into water acidulated with
sulphuric acid. Sulphate of nicotine is thus speedily produced, and this
has to be decomposed by a strong alkali. It is then only necessary to
apply sufficient heat to volatilize the nicotine. This mode of preparation
indicates that smokers in respiring the smoke of tobacco introduce into
their bodies a certain quantity of the vapor of nicotine.</p>

<p><i>Characters of pure Nicotine.</i>—It is in the form of an oleaginous,
transparent, colorless, tolerably fluid, anhydrous liquid, of the density of
1·048, becoming slightly yellow with keeping, and tending to become
brown and thick from contact with the air from which it absorbs oxygen;
its acrid odor resembles but slightly that of tobacco; its taste is very
burning. It volatilizes at 77° F., and leaves a carbonaceous residue.
The vapor which rises presents such a powerful smell of tobacco, and is
so irritating, that it is difficult to breathe in a room in which one drop of
it has been spilt. If this vapor be approached with a lighted taper, it
burns with a white smoky flame, and leaves a carbonaceous residue as an
essential oil would do. It <i>strongly blues</i> reddened litmus paper. <i>It is
very soluble in water</i>, in alcohols, and in fat oils, as also in <i>ether</i>, which
easily separates it from an aqueous solution. The great solubility of
nicotine in both water and ether forms an important fact in its chemical
history, as the greater number of vegetable alkalies, not to say all, if they
dissolve easily in one of these liquids, are not readily soluble
in the other. <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span></p>

<p>Nicotine combines directly with acids, disengaging heat. Concentrated
pure sulphuric acid, without heat, produces with it a wine-red color; on
the application of heat to this it becomes thick, and acquires the color of
the dregs of wine; if it be boiled it blackens and disengages sulphurous
acid. With cold hydrochloric acid it disengages white vapors as ammonia
does; if the mixture be heated it acquires a violet color, the intensity
of which increases with prolonged ebullition. Nitric acid, aided with a
little heat, imparts to it an orange-yellow color, and white vapors of
nitric acid are first given off, then red vapors of hyponitrous acid. If it
be further heated the liquor becomes yellow, and by ebullition it acquires
a red color resembling that of chloride of platinum. Prolonged ebullition
gives a black mass. Heated with stearic acid it dissolves and forms a
soap, which congeals on cooling, and is slightly soluble in water, and very
soluble in heated ether. The simple salts of nicotine are deliquescent,
and difficultly crystallizable. The double salts which it yields with the
different metallic oxides crystallize better.</p>

<p>The aqueous solution of nicotine is colorless, transparent, and strongly
alkaline. It acts like ammonia on several reagents; thus, it gives a white
precipitate with bichloride of mercury, acetate of lead, protochloride and
bichloride of tin; a canary yellow precipitate with chloride of platinum,
which precipitate is soluble in water; a white precipitate with salts of zinc,
which is soluble in excess of nicotine; a blue precipitate with acetate of copper.
This precipitate is gelatinous and soluble in excess of nicotine, forming
a blue double acetate, similar to that formed by ammonia with the same
salt. It gives an ochre-yellow precipitate with salts of the sesqui-oxide of
iron, insoluble in excess of nicotine. With sulphate of protoxide of manganese
it gives a white precipitate of oxide, which speedily becomes brown
by contact with the oxygen of the air. It separates the green sesqui-oxide
from the salts of chromium. The red permanganate of potash is
instantly decolorized by nicotine, as by ammonia, although this latter
alkali acts more slowly and must be used in larger proportion.</p>

<p>The following reactions may serve to distinguish the aqueous solutions
of nicotine from ammonia. Chloride of gold yields a reddish-yellow precipitate,
<i>very soluble in an excess of nicotine</i>. Chloride of cobalt yields a
blue precipitate, which changes to green; the oxide thus formed does not
readily dissolve in excess of nicotine, whilst ammonia dissolves the green
precipitate and forms a red solution. Aqueous solution of iodine gives a
yellow precipitate with solution of nicotine, as chloride
of platinum would <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
do; with an excess of nicotine it acquires a straw color, and it is decolorized
by the action of heat. Ammonia, on the contrary, immediately
decolorizes the aqueous solution of iodine without rendering it turbid.
Pure tannic acid gives with nicotine an abundant white precipitate.
Ammonia gives no precipitate, but imparts a red
color.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanch4">4</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch4" id="fn4">4</a>
It is interesting to compare the physical and chemical properties of nicotine with
those of conicine.</p>

<p>Conicine is yellow; <i>its smell resembles that of the urine of the mouse</i>, and differs
entirely from that of nicotine; it strongly blues reddened litmus paper. Added to
water and shaken with it, it floats on the surface and is not readily dissolved. Ether
dissolves it easily. When heated in a capsule it forms white vapors, <i>having a strong
smell of celery mixed with that of the urine of the mouse</i>. Weak tincture of
the iodine yields a white precipitate, which acquires an olive color with excess of
the tincture. Pure and concentrated sulphuric acid <i>does not alter it</i>; when the mixture
is heated it acquires a greenish brown color, and if the heat be continued it
becomes blood-red and afterwards black. Nitric acid imparts to it a <i>topaz color</i>,
which is not changed by the action of heat. Hydrochloric acid yields white vapors
as ammonia does, and renders it violet, especially when heated. Tannic acid gives
a white precipitate, and chloride of platinum a yellow precipitate. The red permanganate
of potash is immediately decolorized. Corrosive sublimate yields a
white precipitate. Acetate of copper gives a gelatinous blue precipitate, less soluble
in an excess of conicine than is that formed with nicotine. Chloride of cobalt behaves
with it as it does with nicotine. Chloride of gold gives a light yellow precipitate.
<i>Neutral acetate of lead does not give any precipitate</i>; neither does the subacetate.
Chloride of zinc gives a white gelatinous precipitate soluble in excess of the conicine.
Sulphate of sesquioxide of iron gives a yellow precipitate. The words in italics
indicate the means of distinguishing
conicine from nicotine.</p></div>

<p>If to these chemical characters which permit one so easily to distinguish
nicotine, we add those resulting from the action which it exercises on the
animal economy, it will no longer be possible to confound it with any other
body. The following are the results of the experiments I undertook in
1842 on this alkali, and which I published in 1843. (See the 4th edition
of my work on Toxicology.)</p>

<p><i>First Experiment.</i>—I applied three drops of nicotine on the tongue of
a small but sufficiently robust dog; immediately afterwards, the animal
became giddy, and voided urine; at the end of a minute, its breathing
was quick and panting. This state lasted for forty seconds, and then the
animal fell on its right side, and appeared intoxicated. Far from showing
any stiffness or convulsions, it was feeble and flabby, although the fore
paws slightly trembled. Five minutes after the
ad­min­i­stra­tion of the <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
poison, he uttered plaintive cries, and slightly stiffened his neck, carrying
his head slightly backwards. The pupils were excessively dilated; the
respiration was calm, and in no way accelerated. This state lasted ten
minutes, during which the animal was not able to stand. From this time
the effects appeared to diminish, and soon after it might have been predicted
that they would speedily disappear entirely. Next day, the animal was
quite well. The nicotine I used was evidently not anhydrous.</p>

<p><i>Second Experiment.</i>—I repeated the experiment with five drops of
nicotine on a dog of the same description. The animal showed the same
effects, and died at the end of ten minutes, although during four minutes
he showed slight convulsive movements.</p>

<p><i>Opening of the Body the day following.</i>—The membranes of the brain
were slightly injected, and the superficial vessels were gorged with blood;
this injection was especially observed on the left side, and in the lower
part of the brain. The brain itself of the ordinary consistence, had the
two substances of which it is composed, slightly disintegrated, the striated
substance was much injected, as well as the <i>pons varolii</i>. The membranes
which envelope the cerebellum were still more injected than the other
parts. Between the first and second cervical vertebræ on the right side,
that is, on the side on which the animal fell, there was a rather considerable
effusion of blood. The lungs appeared to be in their natural state.
The heart, the vessels of which were gorged with blood, was greatly distended,
especially on the right side, with clots of blood; the auricles and
the right ventricle containing much, and the left ventricle none. The
superior and inferior <i>vena cava</i>, and the aorta, were equally distended with
clots of semi-fluid blood. The tongue was corroded along the middle line,
and towards the posterior part, where the epithelium separated with
facility. In the interior of the stomach there were found a black pitchy
matter and a bloody liquid, which appeared to have resulted from an
exudation of blood. The duodenum was inflamed in patches; the rest of
the intestinal canal appeared in a healthy state.</p>

<p>Since the above period I have made the following experiments, which I
have frequently repeated with the same results, only that in some cases I
have found the blood contained in the cavities of the heart in a fluid state,
even when proceeding to dissection immediately after death; nevertheless
the blood speedily coagulated.</p>

<p><i>Third Experiment.</i>—At eleven o’clock I administered, to a dog of
moderate size, twelve drops of nicotine. A few
instants afterwards <span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
giddiness came on, and <i>he fell on the right side</i>; he soon manifested convulsive
movements, slightly at first, then sufficiently strong to constitute a tetanic
fit with opisthotonos; he was in a remarkable state of drowsiness, and
uttered no cry. His pupils were dilated; there was no action of the
bowels, nor vomiting. He died at two minutes after eleven. The body
was immediately opened. The abdomen and thorax, on being cut open,
<i>sometimes</i> emitted a very decided smell of tobacco. The heart contained
a considerable quantity of <i>black coagulated</i> blood. There was more in the
right auricle and ventricle than in the left. The lungs appeared in a normal
state. The stomach contained about forty grammes of a thick, yellow,
slimy liquid; and here and there parts of the mucous membrane were
inflamed. The œsophagus, the intestines, the liver, the spleen, and the
kidneys, were in a normal state. The epithelium was easily detached from
the tongue; the base of this organ was red and slightly excoriated. The
brain was more injected than its enveloping membranes; the <i>pons varolii</i>
was the same as in the second experiment.</p>

<p><i>Fourth Experiment.</i>—I applied on the eye of a dog of moderate size
one drop of nicotine; the animal instantly became giddy and weak in its
limbs; a minute afterwards he fell on his right side and manifested convulsive
fits, which became more and more powerful; the head was thrown
back. At the end of two minutes the convulsions ceased, and extreme
weakness ensued. Five minutes afterwards the animal could stand, but
was unable to walk. Ten minutes later he was in the same state without
having vomited or had any action of the bowels. Urged to walk, he made
a few undecided steps, then vomited about one hundred grammes of a
greyish alimentary paste. At the end of half an hour he was in the same
state. It was evident that he was recovering. The conjunctiva was
sensibly inflamed, and the transparent cornea was, to a great extent,
opaque.</p>

<p>2. <i>We may detect nicotine in the digestive canal, and affirm its existence
there, although it may be only present to the extent of a few drops.</i> I
would call the particular attention of the Academy to this paragraph; I
have never, in the course of my numerous experiments, seen animals whose
death has been almost instantaneous, either vomit or have any action of
the bowels.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanch5">5</a>
If it be the same with man, as everything tends to prove
it is, the Chemist will, under such circumstances, be in
the most favorable <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
condition for detecting the poison, as there will most frequently be a sufficient
quantity in the canal to determine its presence.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch5" id="fn5">5</a>
If life is prolonged
the animals vomit.</p></div>

<p>Before describing the two processes to which I had recourse for the
determining the existence of nicotine in the stomach and intestines, as well
as in the œsophagus, it may be observed that I acted separately on the
liquid and solid matters contained in these organs, and on the organs themselves.</p>

<p><i>First Process.</i>—The contents of the stomach and intestines, or the
organs themselves, are placed in a considerable proportion of sulphuric
ether; after twelve hours of maceration, it is to be filtered; the ether
passes through, holding nicotine in solution; most frequently when the
matters on which the ether has acted are fatty, the ether holds in solution
a soap composed of nicotine and one or several fatty acids; it may also
happen that it contains non-saponified nicotine. The ethereal liquid is
evaporated almost to dryness by very gentle heat. The greasy and soapy
product obtained rarely shows any alkaline reaction. It is to be agitated,
without heat, with caustic soda dissolved in water, to decompose the soap
and set free the nicotine. The whole is then to be put into a retort
furnished with a receiver plunged in cold water, and heat applied to the
retort until no more liquid remains in it. The liquid condensed in the
receiver contains either all, or at least a large proportion of the nicotine.
It is well to know that, 1st, when heat is applied to the retort, the matter
froths, augments in volume, and would certainly pass into the receiver, if
the retort was not very large in relation to the quantity of liquid operated
upon; 2ndly, even at a temperature of 212° Fahr., the vapor of water
carries with it a certain quantity of nicotine, therefore the operation should
be carried on as much as possible in close vessels. If these precautions be
observed, the distilled liquid will be limpid and colorless; it suffices then
to concentrate it over a water-bath, to about a sixth of its volume, to
obtain with it all the reactions of nicotine.</p>

<p><i>Second Process.</i>—The method of which I am now going to speak is
evidently superior to the preceding. The matters contained in the stomach
and intestines, or the organs themselves, as well as the œsophagus, are
macerated in water acidulated by pure and concentrated sulphuric acid,
taking, for instance, four or five drops of acid to one hundred and fifty or
two hundred grammes of water. At the end of twelve hours it is to be
filtered; the liquid, which is generally of a yellow color, contains sulphate
of nicotine and a certain quantity of organic matter. It is
then to be <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
evaporated almost to dryness in close vessels over a water-bath; then
treated with a few grammes of distilled water which dissolves the sulphate
of nicotine, leaving the greater part of the organic matter undissolved; it
is now to be filtered; the filtered liquor is to be saturated with a little pure
hydrate of soda or potash, in order to take the sulphuric acid, and set
free the nicotine. The mixture of nicotine and of sulphate of soda or
potash is to be put into a retort, and heated as described in the first process;
the distilled liquid is to be evaporated over a water-bath in order to
concentrate the solution of nicotine.</p>

<p>Instead of distilling the liquor by heat, I have often treated it with ether;
this latter decanted and submitted to spontaneous evaporation leaves the
nicotine.</p>

<p>Everything tends to show that nicotine may be detected by other processes.
Thus by treating the digestive canal with absolute alcohol, with
the addition of a little soda, it would be dissolved, and by the reaction of
the soda, a soap would be formed with the fatty matter, which would set
free the nicotine; it would then only remain to distil it by heat, after having
evaporated to dryness. Perhaps, also, it might be separated by acting
on the tissues with pure soda or potash, then evaporating to dryness and
heating it in closed vessels.</p>

<p>3. <i>It is sufficiently easy to prove the presence of nicotine in the
liver and other organs after it has been absorbed.</i>—In 1839 when I had
shown that poisons after having been absorbed might be extracted from
the organs where they had been carried with the blood, I insisted so
strongly on the necessity of examining these organs with a view to the
detection of poisons, that it has now become the custom to proceed in this
way. How often does it happen, that, in consequence of repeated vomiting
and action of the bowels, and also from complete absorption having
taken place, there remains no trace of the poison in the digestive canal?
Moreover, it is evident, that, in getting the poison from the organs to which
it has been carried by absorption, we obtain, in reality, that portion of the
poison which has been the cause of death, unless it be shown that it was
carried to those organs after death by absorption. M. Stas has conformed,
most wisely, to this precept. For my part, I could not, in my researches,
neglect this important branch of the investigation. The livers of those
animals which I had poisoned with twelve or fifteen drops of nicotine,
when submitted to one or other of the processes I have described, furnished
me with appreciable quantities of this alkali. I scarcely
obtained any from <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
the blood contained in the heart, but I had only operated upon a few
grammes. Moreover, experience teaches that a great number of poisons
absorbed rapidly pass from the blood into the organs, and most especially
into the liver.</p>

<p>It may be readily conceived that the research for absorbed nicotine might
be fruitless in those cases where death was occasioned by only a few drops
of this body; but then the presence of the alkali may be detected in the
digestive canal.</p>

<p>Gentlemen, after results such as those obtained by M. Stas and myself,
society may feel satisfied. Without doubt intelligent and skilful criminals,
intent on puzzling the Chemists, will sometimes have recourse to very
active poisons, but little known to the community at large, and difficult to
detect; but science is on the alert to surmount all difficulties. Penetrating
to the recesses of our organs, she extracts evidence of the crime, and
furnishes one of the great elements of conviction against the guilty. Do
we not know that at the present time poisonings by morphine, brucine,
strychnine, nicotine, conicine, hydrocyanic acid, and many other vegetable
substances which were formerly believed to be inaccessible to our means
of investigation, may be discovered and recognised in a manner to be perfectly
char­ac­ter­is­tic?</p>

<p>During my stay at Mons, and consequently since the deposit of this
memoir, I have had at my disposal the complete and remarkable Report
of M. Stas, and I have satisfied myself:―</p>

<p>1st. That this Chemist has obtained nicotine from the tongue, from the
stomach, and liquids contained in it, and also from the liver and lungs of
Gustave Fougnies.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>2ndly. That he also obtained nicotine by properly treating the boards
of the dining-room where Gustave died, although these boards had been
washed with warm water, with oil, and with soap.—<i>Repertoire de Pharmacie.</i></p>

<p>The Count Hippolyte Visarte de Bocarmé confessed his guilt, and was
executed at Mons.</p>

<h3>ON THE ESTIMATION OF THE STRENGTH OF
MEDICINAL HYDROCYANIC ACID, OF BITTER
ALMOND WATER, AND OF CHERRY LAUREL
WATER.
<span class="hsmall">
BY J. LIEBIG.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Liquids which contain prussic acid, and are mixed with caustic potash ley
until they have a strong alkaline reaction, yield, on the gradual addition
of a diluted solution of nitrate of silver, a precipitate, which, on being
shaken, disappears to a certain extent. Alkaline liquids containing prussic
acid, may also be mixed with a few drops of a solution of common salt
without the production of any permanent precipitate, until at last, on an
increased addition, chloride of silver falls down.</p>

<p>This phenomenon depends on the fact that oxide of silver and chloride
of silver are soluble in the generated cyanide of potassium, until there is
found a double salt, composed of equal equivalents of cyanide of potassium
and cyanide of silver, which is not decomposed by an excess of alkali.
Liebig’s method of estimating the prussic acid consists in determining the
quantity of silver which must be added to an alkaline liquid, containing
prussic acid, until a precipitate appears. Each equivalent of silver corresponds
to two equivalents of prussic acid. Having caused several experiments
to be made, which prove the efficacy of this method; and having
carefully observed that the presence of formic acid and muriatic acid in the
prussic acid, does not interfere with the correctness of this method, the
author gives the following directions for examining different liquids containing
prussic acid:—The <i>aqua amygdalarum amarum</i> being turbid,
must be clarified by the addition of a known quantity of water: 63 grs. of
fused nitrate of silver are dissolved in 5937 grs. of water; 300 grs. of this
liquid corresponds to 1 gr. of anhydrous prussic acid. Before applying
the test, the vessel with the solution of silver is to be weighed, and of the
latter so much is added to a weighed quantity (<i>e.g.</i> 60 grs.) of prussic
acid, mixed with a small portion of potash ley and a few drops of a solution
of common salt, shaking it in a common white medicine glass until a
perceptible turbidness takes place, and does not disappear on shaking.
The solution of silver is now again to be weighed; and supposing 360 grs.
are found to have been employed for the test, the 60 grs. of the tested
prussic acid contain 1,20 grs. anhydrous prussic acid, or 100 grs. contain
two grains. <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span></p>

<p>The appearance of a new edition of the Pharmacopœia is to the apothecary
always a matter of high interest; to it he looks for the recognized
improvements in the various processes which he has constantly to
perform; by it essentially he is to be guided in all the officinal preparations
which he makes; and from it he learns what new articles, by their
intrinsic merits and through the vogue they have obtained, are deemed of
sufficient importance to be recognized officinally as additions to the
materia medica. The general arrangement of the new Pharmacopœia is
the same as that of 1840. Owing to the wise principles which governed
the earlier framers of the Pharmacopœia—though, from the progress of
botanical science, the scientific names of the plants to which many of the
articles of the vegetable materia medics are referred, have been changed,
and with improvements in chemistry, the nomenclature of several salts
has been altered—this has led to little alteration in the designations
employed in the Pharmacopœia. Assafœtida is now referred to Narthex
Assafetida, instead of Ferula A.; Diosma is, after the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia,
termed Barosma; Camphor to Camphora officinarum; Cardamom
to Elettaria Cardamomum; Cinchona flava to C. calisaya; Cinchona pallida
to C. condaminea and C. micrantha, while the source of Cinchona
rubra is not yet indicated. Colocynth is now termed the fruit of Citrullus
colocynthis; kino is said to be the inspissated juice of Pterocarpus marsupium,
and of other plants; quassia is referred to Simaruba excelsa, and
uva ursi to Artostaphylos uva-ursi.</p>

<p>Of the names of the articles of the materia medica, as was before
stated, very few are changed. Myroxylon, of the old Pharmacopœia, is
now Balsamum Peruvianum, Tolutanum,
Balsamum Tolutanum; Diosma, <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
after the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, is now Buchu; Zinci carbonas is
changed to the old name, calamina; iodinum, following the British Pharmacopœias,
is iodinium, and brominum, brominium. Port wine has been
introduced, and consequently, instead of the Vinum of 1840, we have
now Vinum Album, Sherry, and Vinum Rubrum, Port Wine.</p>

<p>The secondary list of the materia medica, a peculiarity of our national
pharmacopœia, is still retained, to what good purpose it is hard to understand.
The framers of the book state that “it has the advantage of permitting
a discrimination between medicines of acknowledged value and
others of less estimation, which, however, may still have claims to
notice.” The advantage is not a very evident one. The distinction that
is attempted is very difficult to make satisfactorily; it will vary with individuals,
and, we fancy, too, with the place at which it is made. Certainly
few in New York would put Angostura bark with Horsemint (Monarda), and
Queen’s root (Stillingia) in the primary list; while Apocynum cannabinum,
one of the most active of our diuretics, and Malefern, in tape-worm, one
of the most certain anthelmintics, are exiled to the secondary. If popular,
instead of professional reputation, is to be the criterion, are not
Arnica, and Matricaria, and Benne leaves, and horehound, quite as well
entitled to a place in the primary list as many of the articles that now
figure there? And are there not twenty simples in use among the old
women of the country that deserve a place in the national Pharmacopœia
as well as may weed, and frost wort, and fever root? Though, too, new
articles should not readily be admitted until time has fixed their value, we
should like to have seen some notice of Matico and of the salts of
Valerianic acid. We are sorry, too, to see the old definition of rhubarb still
adhered to; “the root of Rheum palmatum and of other species of
Rheum;” that of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, “the root of an unknown
species of Rheum,” thus rendering the Russian or Chinese rhubarb alone
officinal, is very much preferable.</p>

<p>Of the substances introduced into the Materia Medica, the chief are
Aconite root (aconiti radix), Extractum cannabis (extract of hemp), Oleum
morrhuæ (cod liver oil), Oleum amygdalæ amaræ (oil of bitter almonds),
and Potassæ chloras (chlorate of potassa). By Arnica in the last Pharmacopœia
was understood the root and herb of Arnica montana; for these, in
the present—the name remaining unchanged—the flowers are substituted.
The additions to the Materia Medica have been made with judgment, and certainly
nothing has been admitted with the exception
perhaps of <span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span>
Helianthemum (Frostwort), of doubtful utility, or that has not for some time been
submitted to the test of experience.</p>

<p>The preparations introduced are all familiar to the pharmaceutist, and
have for a long time been kept in most good shops. It is singular that
in the last Pharmacopœia, by nitrate of silver was understood the fused
nitrate. This oversight has been corrected, and by Argenti nitras now is
understood the salt in crystals, while the common lunar caustic is Argenti
nitras fusa. Among the new preparations are the active principles of
Aconitum Napellus (Aconitia), Oxide of Silver, Iodide of Arsenic, Chloroform,
Collodion, a number of fluid extracts, Citrate of Iron, Glycerine,
Solution of Citrate of Magnesia, the oils of Copaiba, Tobacco, and Valerian,
Iodide of Lead, Potassa cum calce, Bromide of Potassium, Syrup of
Wild Cherry bark—of gum—and Tinctures of Aconite root, Kino, and
Nux Vomica, and compound tincture of Cardamom.</p>

<p>The Iron by hydrogen, as it has been sometimes rather awkwardly
termed, the Fer réduit of the French, after the British Pharmacopœias, is
termed Ferri pulvis, powder of iron. Soubeiran’s formula for the preparation
of Donovan’s Liquor (Liquor Arsenici et Hydrargyri Iodidi) is
given as much simpler and of easier preparation than the original formula of
Donovan; there is, too, a good formula for the extemporaneous preparations
of pills of iodide of iron. The solution of the Persesquinitrate of
Iron, as it has been sometimes termed, appears as solution of Nitrate of
Iron; it is a preparation that soon becomes altered by keeping. Tincture
of Aconite root is directed to be made by macerating a pound of bruised
Aconite root for fourteen days with two pints of alcohol, expressing and
filtering. A process by percolation is also given. This is weaker than
the tincture of either of the British Pharmacopœias, and weaker, we
believe, than the tincture ordinarily employed here. As an external
application, for which it is chiefly used, this is a great disadvantage, and
when administered internally, the varying strength of a medicine so powerful
will be attended with serious evils.</p>

<p>The old formulæ for the preparation of the alcoholic extract of aconite
and of the extractum aconiti (expressed juice), are retained, both being
made from the leaves. The extracts when thus made, even when properly
prepared, are for the most part inert. No formula is given for the
preparation of an alcoholic extract from the root.</p>

<p>There are three new preparations among the ointments:—Unguentum
Belladonnæ, Potassii Iodidi, and Sulphuris Iodidi. The
ointment of Iodide <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
of Potassium is directed to be made by dissolving a drachm of the iodide in
a drachm of boiling water, and afterwards incorporating the solution
with the lard.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>On the whole, there is much more to praise than to find fault with in
the Pharmacopœia. Upon some of the preparations we will hereafter
find further occasion perhaps to comment.</p>

<h3>PHARMACEUTICAL CONVENTION.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In pursuance of a call issued by the College of Pharmacy of the City of New
York, a Committee of Delegates from the different Colleges of Pharmacy in the
United States assembled at the College Rooms in New York at 5 o’clock P. M. on
Wednesday, the 15th of October.</p>

<p>Delegates from Philadelphia and Boston were in attendance. The Maryland
College (at Baltimore) and the Cincinnati College were not represented, although
Delegates from each had been previously reported to the Committee of Arrangements
in New York. A communication of some length was received from the
Cincinnati Delegation.</p>

<p>The Convention was organized by the appointment of Mr. Charles Ellis of Philadelphia
as Chairman, and Dr. Samuel R. Philbrick of Boston as Secretary, pro tem.
A Committee was then appointed by the nomination of each delegation, consisting
of Messrs. Samuel M. Colcord of Boston, Alfred B. Taylor of Philadelphia, and
George D. Coggeshall of New York, to examine credentials and nominate officers
for the Convention. The Committee retired, and on their return reported the credentials
satisfactory, and proposed Dr. B. Guthrie of New York as President, and
Mr. Alfred B. Taylor of Philadelphia as Secretary, who were unanimously confirmed.</p>

<p>Dr. Guthrie, on taking the chair, made a few remarks expressive of his sense of
the honor conferred by appointing him presiding officer of the first Convention of the
kind ever held in the United States, and explanatory of the objects of the Convention,
which were in accordance with the growing feeling amongst druggists and phar­ma­ceu­tists
of its necessity to establish standards of the qualities of imported Drugs
and Medicines for the government of the United States Inspectors at the different
ports, and in addition to act upon such matters of general interest to the Profession
as may be presented to the consideration of the Convention.</p>

<p>Reports were presented by the majority (Messrs. Guthrie and Coggeshall) and the
minority (Mr. Merrick) of the New York delegates, embodying their views upon the
subject of standards, and also in regard to false drugs which should be excluded.</p>

<p>A communication from the Cincinnati Delegates was read, and Mr. Restieaux of
Boston read an interesting statement of the working of the Drug Law in that
city. <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span></p>

<p>A general discussion ensued upon various topics connected with the business of the
Convention, and resulted in the appointment of a committee, consisting of Messrs.
Proctor of Philadelphia, Restieaux of Boston, and Coggeshall of New York, to
consider the several communications, and to arrange the general plan of business,
and report at the next sitting.</p>

<p>The Convention then adjourned to Thursday, at 12 o’clock.</p>

<p class="padtopc"><i>Second sitting, Oct. 16th.</i>—The Convention met at 12 o’clock. The Committee
appointed yesterday made a report, reviewing the numerous propositions presented
by the different Colleges, and submitting a general system for regulating standards,
which, in their judgment, should prevail uniformly at the ports of entry, with
numerous specifications of prominent articles to which their attention was called by
their importance, and the difficulty that has been sometimes found in deciding upon
them.</p>

<p>The report was considered in sections in a lengthy and very interesting discussion,
in which the members generally participated. With some amendments it was
adopted.</p>

<p>The Committee also offered the following preamble and resolutions, which were
adopted, viz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W<b>HEREAS,</b></span> The advancement of the true interests of the great body of Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal
practitioners in all sections of our country is a subject worthy earnest consideration;
and whereas Phar­ma­ceu­tists, in their intercourse among themselves, with
physicians and the public, should be governed by a code of ethics calculated to elevate
the standard and improve the practice of their art; and whereas, the means of a
regular phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal education should be offered to the rising Phar­ma­ceu­tists by
the establishment of Schools of Pharmacy in suitable locations; and whereas, it is
greatly to be desired that the united action of the profession should be directed to the
accomplishment of these objects; therefore,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That, in the opinion of this Convention, much good will result from a
more extended intercourse between the Phar­ma­ceu­tists of the several sections of the
Union, by which their customs and practice may be assimilated; that Phar­ma­ceu­tists
would promote their individual interests and advance their professional standing
by forming associations for mutual protection, and the education of their assistants,
when such associations have become sufficiently matured; and that, in view of these
important ends, it is further</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a Convention be called, consisting of three delegates each from
incorporated and unincorporated Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Societies, to meet at Philadelphia
on the first Wednesday in October, 1852, when all the important questions bearing
on the profession may be considered, and measures adopted for the organization of
a National Association, to meet every year.</p>

<p>On motion, it was resolved that the New York Delegation be appointed a Committee
to lay the proceedings of this Convention before the Secretary of the Treasury
of the United States, and afterwards have them published in pamphlet form.</p>

<p>Dr. Philbrick of Boston offered the following preamble and resolution, which were
adopted:― <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">W<b>HEREAS,</b></span> To secure the full benefits of the prohibition of sophisticated drugs and
chemicals from abroad, it is necessary to prevent home adulteration; therefore,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this Convention recommend to the several Colleges to adopt such
measures as in their respective states may be best calculated to secure that object.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Colcord of Boston, it was</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a committee of three be appointed by this Convention to act as a
Standing Committee to collect and receive such information as may be valuable, and
memorials and suggestions from any Medical and Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Association, to be
presented at the next Convention.</p>

<p>The President appointed G. D. Coggeshall of New York, S. M. Colcord of Boston,
and W. Proctor, Jr., of Philadelphia, as the Committee.</p>

<p>A vote of thanks to the officers was passed, and then the Convention adjourned,
to meet in Philadelphia on the first Wednesday in October, 1852.</p>

<p>The following circular letter has since been issued by the President of the Convention,
and addressed to the leading Phar­ma­ceu­tists throughout the Union:―</p>

unanimously adopted:―</p>

Restieaux, and Coggeshall.]</p>

<p>The objects set forth in the above, I trust, will meet the hearty approbation of

proposed association.</p>

<p>Our medical brethren have, as you are doubtless aware, an organization, similar in
character, holding its sessions annually, in which all matters pertaining to their profession
are fully discussed—the beneficial effects of which are already apparent,
though the association has been in existence but a few years.</p>

<p>They cannot give to the subject of Pharmacy the attention it requires and deserves,
neither is it a matter legitimately falling under their cognizance, but belongs to Phar­ma­ceu­tists
themselves.</p>

<p>The medical profession and the community at large rightfully look to us for the
correction of any existing abuses, the advancement of the science, and the elevation
of the business of an apothecary to the dignity and standing of a profession.</p>

<p>To this end we invite you to the formation of such Associations, in view of the
Convention, to be held in Philadelphia, on the first Wednesday of October, 1852.</p>

<h3>ON THE PREPARATION OF PURE HYDRATE OF
POTASH AND CARBONATE OF POTASH.
<span class="hsmall">
BY HENRY WURTZ, A. M.</span></h3>

<p>In preparing pure potash compounds, it is highly necessary,
especially in order to avoid the possibility of the presence of
soda, to select, as a starting point, some compound of potash
which differs considerably in solubility from the corresponding
soda compound. Either the bitartrate or the sulphate, therefore,
is usually preferred.</p></div><!--chapter-->

<p>The bitartrate is ignited; the carbonaceous mass, washed with
water, and the solution of carbonate of potash, thus obtained,
diluted and boiled with slack lime, in the usual way, in an iron
kettle; the solution of hydrate of potash, thus obtained, is boiled
to dryness, and the alcoholic solution of the residue evaporated
in silver dishes, to obtain what is denominated <i>alcoholic
potash</i>. This product should be, and most usually is, entirely
free from sulphate of potash and chloride of potassium, since
it is easy to crystallize the bitartrate free from these salts.</p>

<p>But an almost invariable accompaniment of this alcoholic
potash is a trace of silicate of potash. The solution may assume
no cloudiness on the addition of solution of chlorohydrate
of ammonia, or upon addition of an excess of chlorohydric acid,
and afterwards an excess of ammonia; but on adding excess of
chlorohydric acid, and evaporation to dryness in
a platinum <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
capsule, the aqueous solution of the residue will be found to have
flakes of silica floating in it. Very few specimens that I have
met with have stood this test. It is to be inferred that the soluble
silicates of potash are not wholly insoluble in alcohol; but a
question arises concerning the source from whence the silica is
so frequently derived. It may be from the lime used, in some
cases, or from silicium contained in the iron of the kettles employed.
I am enabled to state, in addition, that of many specimens
of commercial <i>carbonate of potash</i> which I have examined,
some of which purported to have been prepared from cream
of tartar by the method above alluded to, none have been
found entirely free from silica. I have even found traces of
this impurity in crystals of commercial <i>bicarbonate of potash</i>.</p>

<p>This constant contamination of potash, and carbonate of potash
with silica, being a very important matter in consideration
of the frequent use of these two substances in chemical analysis,
I have been induced to devise a means of separating the silica
from the carbonate. This I have accomplished by the use of
carbonate of ammonia.</p>

<p>An aqueous solution of the carbonate which is to be freed
from silica is evaporated to dryness on the sand bath (best in a
sheet iron dish), adding from time to time lumps of carbonate
of ammonia. The silicate is thus converted into carbonate, and
on dissolving the residue of the evaporation in water, the silica
appears in the form of flakes floating in the liquid, and may be
separated by filtration. This solution of carbonate of potash,
free from silica, may now be used for the preparation of pure
hydrate of potash, taking care to use lime which is also free
from silica.</p>

<p>I may here introduce a few words with regard to the preservation
of hydrate of potash for use in analysis. Its preservation
in the solid form is evidently no difficult matter; but when
we attempt to keep the solution in glass bottles for the sake of
convenience in using it as a re-agent, we generally find that it
very soon takes up silica from the glass. I have found, however,
that flint glass bottles will preserve such
a solution much <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
longer than any other, lead glass not being easily acted upon,
probably because it contains very much less silica. It might
not be useless to make a trial of bottles made of thin soft iron,
or sheet iron, for this purpose; but it is probable that pure <i>silver</i>
is the true material for bottles, in which solution of potash
is to be preserved. A very thin shell of silver might first be
made, and afterwards strengthened by coating it thickly with
galvanic copper.</p>

<p>The ease with which sulphate of potash can be obtained, in a
state of purity, has long ago suggested its use as a material
from which to prepare pure potash. Schubert<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanch6">6</a>
proposed to
treat pulverized pure sulphate of potash with a concentrated solution
of pure baryta, the latter somewhat in excess, and during
the evaporation of the solution of hydrate of potash, thus obtained,
the excess of the baryta is precipitated by the carbonic acid
of the air. This, however, appears to be very expensive process.
I have devised another method of treating pure sulphate
of potash so as to obtain pure hydrate of potash therefrom; it
consists merely in operating upon the sulphate of potash in a
manner similar to that in which sulphate of baryta is operated
upon to procure hydrate of baryta, that is in converting the
sulphate into sulphide by the conjoined application of a reducing
agent and a red heat, and to decompose the aqueous solution
of the sulphide by the action of an oxide of a metal whose
sulphide is insoluble, such as oxide of iron (?), oxide of copper
or deutoxide of manganese. I use as a reducing agent, instead
of charcoal, oil, rosin, etc., <i>coal gas</i>. This application of coal
gas was proposed by Dr. Wolcott Gibbs. If it is found that
the decomposition is not perfect, and that the solution of sulphide
of potassium contains some sulphate of potash, or if a
little sulphate is formed in the solution by oxidation, it is removed
by the introduction of a little solution of baryta, according
to the method of Schubert. I am not yet prepared, however,
to give the details of this method.</p>

<h3>ON THE PREPARATION OF CHEMICALLY PURE
HYDRATE AND CARBONATE OF SODA.
<span class="hsmall">
BY HENRY WURTZ, A. M.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The remarks made in the last article with reference to the
presence of silica in alcoholic potash, apply also, though not so
generally, to commercial alcoholic soda. Few specimens of this
product are met with which are so free from silica that it cannot
be detected by saturation with chlorohydric acid, evaporation
to dryness in a platinum vessel, and redissolution in water.
Whatever may be the origin of the silica in this case, it is very
often present.</p>

<p>I have selected, as the most convenient substance from which
to prepare pure hydrate and carbonate of soda, a product which
occurs very abundantly in commerce under the name of “carbonate
of soda.” It is in the form of a very fine white powder,
and on examination turns out to be the ordinary monohydrated
<i>bicarbonate</i> of soda.</p>

<div>NaO, 2 C.O<sup>2</sup> + H.O.</div>

<p>For, upon ignition, 7.756 grns. lost, 2.7595 grns. of carbonic
acid and water, which is equal to 35.60 per cent.; bicarbonate
of soda should lose 36.88 per cent. It may be mentioned, in this
connection, that a preparation sent over here by Button, a
London Pharmaceutist, under the appellation of “Chemically
Pure Carbonate of Soda,” upon examination turned out to be
also <i>bicarbonate</i>. 2.324 grns. lost by ignition; 0.845 grn.
= 36.45 per cent.</p>

<p>The commercial bicarbonate above mentioned, contains, of
course, all the impurities of the carbonate from which it is
made, this being an inevitable consequence of the method by
which it is manufactured, which, as described in Knapp’s
Chemical Technology, is simply to expose commercial crystals
of carbonate of soda to the action of carbonic acid gas, which it
takes up to the extent of one equivalent, falling into a fine powder,
with evolution of heat and loss of water of cry­stal­li­za­tion.
These impurities, in the case of the specimen
operated upon by <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
me, were, besides considerable silica, sulphate of soda, chloride
of sodium, a trace of phosphoric acid detected by monohydrate
of ammonia, and a little organic matter which imparted to the
mass a soapy smell.</p>

<p>The sulphate, phosphate and chloride are easily removed by
washing with water by decantation, with a loss, however, of at
least one half of the material. When the washings, after addition
of excess of nitric acid, no longer react with nitrate of silver,
or with chloride of barium, the mass is introduced into porcelain
dishes, and dried on the sand bath; when dry it is exposed to a
high sand bath heat, though not to a red heat, for two or three
hours. By this treatment, not only are one equivalent of carbonic
acid, and one equivalent of water expelled, but the
greater part or the whole of the silicate is decomposed and converted
into carbonate, so that a solution of the mass in water
will now be found full of flakes of silica.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The filtered solution should now be tested for silica, and if not
yet entirely free from it, must be evaporated again to dryness,
with addition of lumps of carbonate of ammonia, exactly as
proposed by me, in the last article, to separate silica from carbonate
of potash. The residue of this last evaporation, on solution
in water, filtration and evaporation in platinum, silver, or
even clean sheet iron (never in glass or porcelain) dishes, will
give pure carbonate of soda, from which may be prepared the
pure hydrate of soda, observing the precaution of using lime
which is free from silica.</p>

<h3>REMARKS UPON SOME OF THE PRE­PAR­A­TIONS
OF THE PHAR­MA­CO­PŒIA OF THE UNIT­ED
STATES, 1851.
<span class="hsmall">
BY GEORGE D. COGGESHALL.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The Pharmacopœia of the United States is, or should be,
to the Pharmaceutist of the United States, his text book and
standard. In making its preparations he should not vary from
the letter of its directions, unless a change of process effects a
quicker, more uniform, or more elegant result; in regard to
strength he should not vary at all, except upon distinct understanding
with the physician prescribing, or with his customer.
It is much to be regretted that perfect conformity throughout
the United States, with our National Pharmacopœia should
not prevail, so that our citizens, traveling or removing with prescriptions,
or copies of them, might not be subjected to inconvenient,
and even in some cases to dangerous alterations, impairing
confidence in the medicine relied upon, or involving
the safety of the patient in using it. With these important
considerations in view, the apothecary should, as far as circumstances
permit, conform strictly to the acknowledged standard,
giving up his own opinions, if need be, for the general good.
But strict adherence to the formulæ of our Pharmacopœia seems
not to be practicable in all cases, in all localities. When there
is such diversity of practice in the City of Philadelphia and in
New York, within five hours of each other, with intercommunication
five times a day, in each of which the formation and
subsequent revisions of the Pharmacopœia have been of such
especial interest and attention, how can it be expected that
in our widely extended country, in communities diversified
almost as much as those of different nations, with many local
habits, set by time and many prejudices, a full and uniform
compliance with the official standard should prevail.</p>

<p>In New York it would disappoint the physician to put
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u0292.ezh.jpg"
 width="37" height="84" alt="ʒ" />ss</span> of
the officinal Solution of Sulphate of Morphia
into a <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
prescription of
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />iv
cough mixture, as much, if not as unpleasantly, as
it would the Philadelphia physician for one of our brethren in
that city to put <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />j of Majendie’s strength into a mixture of the
same bulk. In New York the original strength of this solution
has ever been preserved, not­with­stand­ing the change made
officinal in three editions of our Pharmacopœia, and it is generally
understood and used accordingly. With us the change has
been remonstrated against, as unnecessary, because the dose can
be as easily regulated as that of Fowler’s, or Donovan’s, or
Lugol’s solution, the tinctures of aconite root, belladonna,
iodine, and many other potent preparations; it may just as
easily be preserved from doing mischief, and has often the advantage
in mixtures of not displacing desirable adjuncts with
superfluous water. It is true, that owing to the great difference
in strength of the solution commonly understood here, and
that of the Pharmacopœia, our College has felt it incumbent to
request physicians to designate the intended one, by affixing
a term (in brackets or otherwise) as “Maj,” or “Ph. U.S,” to
avoid the possibility of misconstruction, except in clear cases as
that of the mixture above mentioned; and that we should not
feel justified in dispensing an ounce of Majendie’s solution
alone, (especially if the prescription was for “Liquor Morphiæ,
Sulphatis”—the officinal term) unless with an understanding of
the strength wanted, or of the use to be made of it. This great
discrepancy between what is of original and continued use and
what is officinal, requires watchfulness, on our part, against
occasional exceptions to the general prescription of our physicians,
and in putting up prescriptions written in other places,
Philadelphia particularly. We must judge of the solution required,
from the context.</p>

<p>Our Pharmacopœia, in most of its formulæ, is undoubtedly
entitled to our full respect and adherence, exhibiting on the
part of the Revising Committee, laborious research and patient
adjustment of details. But some of them, I think, are fairly
open to criticism and susceptible of improvement. The formula
given for preparing “<span class="smcap">C<b>ARBONIC</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>CID</b></span>
<span class="smcap">W<b>ATER,</b>”</span> is one
by which it <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
may safely be said, no practical man ever has made, or ever can
make, the article commonly known as mineral, or soda water, the
latter name given to it in its early manufacture; when a portion
of carbonate of soda entered into its composition, which is now
generally omitted, though the name is retained in many places.
In the first United States Pharmacopœia, 1820, the formula
given is as follows:―</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Take of water any quantity.</p>

<p>Impregnate it with about ten times its volume of carbonic
acid gas by means of a forcing pump.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That was, probably, about the strength it was usually made
at that time. It is now, generally made about one fifth or one
fourth stronger. In the revision of 1830, the formula was changed
as follows:―</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“By means of a forcing pump, throw into a suitable receiver,
nearly filled with Water, a quantity of Carbonic Acid equal to
five times the bulk of the Water.”</p>

<p>“Carbonic Acid is obtained from the Hard Carbonate of
Lime by means of dilute Sulphuric Acid.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The latter formula is repeated in the revisions of 1840 and
1850, substituting the term “Marble,” for “Hard Carbonate
of Lime.” The strength was altered from “ten times” of the
first edition to “five times,” in 1830, and reiterated in 1840
and 1850. Why? “Ten times” was, perhaps, sufficient in the
early use of this beverage, but was hardly considered strong
enough in 1830, certainly was not in 1840, and has not been
since. It is difficult to conceive a reason for such change.
Surely, it could not have been recommended by practical men;
on the contrary it was supposed to have been made by mistake
or inadvertance. It is still more difficult to find a good reason
for repeating this formula in the revisions of 1840 and 1850.
Upon each of the latter occasions the College of Pharmacy, in
New York, remonstrated against it and pointed out fully its absurdity.
Carbonic Acid Water of that strength, it was stated,
would not be acceptable as a drink to any one
familiar with it, <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
nor refreshing to the sick. The formula was also shown to be
defective in several essential particulars, and where it was not
defective it was wrong. But our remonstrance seems not to
have been vouchsafed “even the cold respect of a passing
glance.”</p>

<p>The formula is defective in not describing the vessel in which
the preparation is to be made. In other processes, not so much
involving the safety of those engaged in them, the vessels are
specified, as “glass,” “earthen,” “iron,” &amp;c. In this case it
is indispensable that the vessel should be expressly and well
adapted to the purpose. It should be of undoubted strength to
sustain the pressure, and it should be of material not acted upon
by the acid or water. These requisites should not be neglected.
We need not concern ourselves much, to be sure, about “five
times the bulk,” but to make carbonic acid water of good
quality, the “receiver” should be of sufficient strength to ensure
safety, and of internal material to avoid unpleasant or injurious
contamination. Copper fountains, lined with tin, are
mostly used. Cast iron, lined with tin, is also used, to some extent.
So far the formula is defective,—in the proportion both of
water and carbonic acid it is wrong. The “suitable receiver”
should not be “nearly filled with water.” How near full that
is, is left to the chance of different judgment in different persons;
but if “nearly filled” should be understood to mean within
a pint, and force enough could be applied, “the receiver”
would burst before the “five times” could be got into it,
though the breaking in this case would not, probably, be attended
with danger to the operator, because it would be merely a
dead strain without much expansive force.</p>

<p>I do not propose to detail the process of making soda or
mineral water, “Carbonic Acid Water,” as it is properly called
in the Pharmacopœia. The minutiæ of its preparation may well
be left to the experience and practice of the operator. But the
formula given in our standard book should not be defective or
wrong in prominent principles, it should accord with experience
and the improvement of the times. There does
not appear to <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
be any good reason for altering the formula of 1820, which was
comparatively “well enough” to that of 1830, ’40 and ’50, which
is of no value. After designating the description of fountain
required, so far, at least, as regards strength (which ought to
be equal to the pressure of twenty atmospheres), and material,
it should direct it to be supplied with water to the extent of about
five sevenths of its capacity, in order to allow of due admixture
of gas and water, and of agitation which greatly facilitates
it, and the forcing carbonic acid into it to the extent of at least
twelve times the bulk of the water. Thirteen or fourteen times
is often employed for draught, and seventeen or eighteen times
for bottling. It may be, as it has been, said that “a formula
for this preparation is not of great moment.” It may be so; it
may, perhaps, as safely be left to the skill of the manufacturer
and the taste of the consumer, as “Mistura Spiritus Vini Gallici;”
but “if it be worth doing at all, it is worth doing well;”
if placed in the Pharmacopœia, it should be in accordance with
knowledge, and the experience of practical men.</p>

has been made by
some Apothecaries, with myself, for several years, by substituting
92 grs. of bicarbonate of potassa, as the equivalent of 64 grs.
of the carbonate, by which we feel more confident of obtaining a
definite compound than by the employment of the Carbonate,
as generally procured, which mostly contains silica and other
contaminations. The resulting compound is quite satisfactory,
and keeps well. We also omit the compound spirit of lavender,
making up the measure of a pint with water. Our object in this
is two-fold. The solution is more permanent, according to our
observation, and the compound spirit of lavender only renders
it (if anything) more attractive in taste and smell, to children
and ignorant persons.</p>

<p>In making <span class="smcap">M<b>ISTURA</b></span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>ERRI</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>OMPOSITA,</b></span> it is peculiarly
necessary to proceed exactly according to rule, both in the order
of its components and in the method of adding them, to
produce a correct result. In the Pharmacopœia the six ingredients
are set down thus:― <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span></p>

<div class="dpoembox"><ul class="ulstnz">
<li class="livs">
 <span class="spquote">“</span>Take of Myrrh a drachm.</li>
<li class="livs">
 <span class="spquotenada">Carbonate</span> of Potassa twenty-five grains.</li>
<li class="livs">
 <span class="spquotenada">Sulphate</span> of Iron, in powder, a scruple.</li>
<li class="livs">
 <span class="spquotenada">Spirit</span> of Lavender half a fluid ounce.</li>
<li class="livs">
 <span class="spquotenada">Sugar</span> a drachm.</li>
<li class="livs">
 <span class="spquotenada">Rose</span> Water seven fluid ounces and a half.”</li>
</ul>
</div><!--dpoembox-->

<p>We are directed to rub the first with the last, “and then
mix with these” the fourth, the fifth, the second, and “lastly,”
the third.</p>

<p>In the written process for making a mixture, which more
than most others, requires exact method, and the adding of
each of its numerous components in its right order, it would
seem to be desirable, for the sake of perspicuity, to set them
down in the order in which they are to be used. Here we have to
chase about, forwards and backwards, for the one wanted next,
and to read over and over the directions, to make sure of getting
them right; for few of us make this mixture so often as to be perfectly
familiar with the process, without referring to the text. It
is not less awkward in this case from the directions chancing to
be over leaf. But the formula is otherwise defective, I think, not
being quite equal to that of 1830, in which the rose water and
spirit of lavender are directed to be added together. Not only
should these be mixed before using, but the myrrh, carbonate
of potassa and sugar should be triturated well together, and
rubbed with successive portions of the mixed liquids, effecting
thereby a better solution of the myrrh. The mixture, then
complete, except the sulphate of iron, should be put into the
vial, and the salt should, by all means, be directed to be selected
in clear crystals, to avoid any per salt of iron; it should be
quickly powdered in a clean mortar, and added to the contents
of the vial. The result is a bluish colored mixture, soon
changing to olive green. If the sulphate of iron be not properly
selected, or if it be rubbed in the mortar, as inferred from the
formula, the mixture is more or less brown and proportionably
deteriorated. Of course, we should not “take sulphate of iron
in powder.” <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span></p>

<p>In giving directions for making a compound, something,
certainly, is to be expected from the knowledge and skill of the
manipulator. But essential points should not be left to him,
and a formula for a mixture, probably not very often made by
Apothecaries throughout our country towns, should be set down
so clearly, that a person competent to put up mixtures generally,
could make this one the first time he was called upon for it, without
needless perplexity, and with sufficient detail of essentials to
ensure its being made correctly. I have been frequently told by
physicians that, even here, this mixture, requiring so much nicety
of manipulation, does not appear to be made right one time in ten.
This may not be so much the fault of the Apothecary as of his
guide. He makes the mixture but seldom, and if he make it by
his Pharmacopœia he does not make it as well as it can be made.
For convenient use in the shop, I have the following process written
out:―</p>

<p>I have often thought that if our formulæ, especially
those that are complicated, were given in proper rotation,
placing the component first to be used, first in the list, the
second next, and so on, with intermediate lines of direction, which
might be in smaller type or italics, it would derogate nothing
from the dignity of the book, while it would facilitate the process,
and might sometimes obviate misconstruction, or neglect
of particulars essential to the best result.</p>

<h3>LETTER ON OPIUM, &amp;c.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p class="fsz6">[<span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b></span> following letter, addressed to a Commercial House in this City, will be
found to communicate some interesting information. We print it as it is written.
Perhaps our readers may derive some information from the prices given; we can
make nothing of them.]</p>

<p class="psignature padtopc"><span class="smcap">C<b>ONSTANTINOPLE,</b></span>
May 10, 1851.</p>

<p class="pfirst">To ———— <span class="smcap">T<b>RIESTE,</b></span></p>

<p>We received your honored letter, dated Messina, with great
pleasure, and hasten to give you the information you desire,
hoping and wishing that both an agreeable and useful connection
may arise from it, for which purpose we shall not fail to
give your House direct information, respecting the articles
you mention. Opium is found here in different qualities, the
goodness of which chiefly depends on the cons­cien­tious­ness of
those who prepare it. The best quality coming from some districts
of Asia consists of the pure juice, which flows spontaneously
from the incisions made in the poppy heads, is inspissated
and formed into little balls. It has eminently all the
qualities which are requisite in good opium, and contains from
8 to 10 per cent, and more, of morphia. This sort is the most
in request among the druggists in Germany and France, to be
sold by retail to the apothecaries, but scarcely forms the 8th or
10th part of all the Turkish opium which comes to the market.
Next to this is the ordinary quality, coming from the other
provinces of Asia Minor; where in preparing it, they are less
cautious, partly pressing the poppy heads, in order to get as
much juice as possible, partly scraping the juice that has oozed
out too hard, by which certain mucilaginous parts of the plant,
and shavings of the rind get mixed up with it; in this way that
kind of opium is produced, which is so often sold, and at Trieste
bears the name of Tarense opium.</p>

<p>By this proceeding, of course, the morphia is lessened, and
often in a great degree; but in the Chinese market, in proportion
to which, the consumption of the article in all other countries
is scarcely to be reckoned, little or no regard
is paid to <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
this, which explains why the latter inferior article always brings
nearly as high a price as the former pure quality. Besides
these, several sorts of adulterated opium are sold, some of which
are prepared, (principally for the North American market,) by
mixing in the juice of the whole plant, or other substances.—The
difference of the qualities would be best perceived by a
collection of samples, which we should be glad to send you, if
you would tell us where to direct them. The price of the aforementioned
prime quality, which we call “Gúeve,” from the district
which chiefly produces it, is now
<span class="nowrap">10&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub>&#xfeff;c.</span> for the English
pound, free on board. The current second quality,
<span class="nowrap">10&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub>&#xfeff;c.</span> The
price of the adulterated is much lower, in proportion to the
amount of the adulteration; which, however, in most cases, is
not discernible by the exterior. The prices are, of course, principally
regulated by the Chinese market; yet the more or less
considerable crop produced is not without influence. So especially
now, the growers show little inclination to sell, as the new
plantations are endangered by a continual want of rain.—Nevertheless,
probably after two months, when the new crop
begins to come to market, we may be able to buy cheaper than
now, if the news from China should not cause the price to rise.</p>

<p>As regards scammony, almost everything that has been said
respecting opium is literally applicable. The difference in
quality depends upon the way of preparing it, while the plant
from which it is taken is always the same. The best sort is the
pure dried juice, which spontaneously flows from the incisions
made in the root of the plant; the next quality is produced by
a strong pressure of the root. These two qualities go in commerce
by the name of the 1st and 2nd scammony d’Aleppo,
which name, however, is wrong, as Aleppo produces the 1st
quality, but only in a very small quantity, whilst the greater
part comes from several districts of Asia Minor. Then follows
the so called quality of Skilip, a district that produces much,
but where they have the bad habit of trying to gain in the
weight, by adulterating the pure substance. The adulteration
is made in several ways; the least injurious of
which perhaps is, <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
that they add (as in opium), the pressed or boiled out juice of the
whole plant; the not inconsiderable quantities of this sort, which
are yearly brought from the interior, find a good sale in Europe,
which would hardly last, if a sufficient quantity of the before
mentioned finer qualities were to be had. Besides these, a
number of other sorts are sold in Europe, under the name of
Smyrna scammony, which consist of a hard and heavy mass,
but contain only a very small part of the real scammony.</p>

<p>With this article it would also be necessary, as we said with
the opium, to explain our statements by sending you samples,
which we will do if you desire it. The finest prime sort is seldom
found, and is now entirely wanting. It would sell readily
at the rate of
<span class="nowrap">21&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>c.</span> per pound, English. The good second
quality brings according to the sort, from 18c. to
<span class="nowrap">15&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>c.</span> a
pound, free on board, but is also now very scarce, and will, in
the course of two or three months, be more abundant in fresh
quality. Of the Skilip sort, there are several quantities in the
market, according to the quality, at the price of 13 to 10s.
10d. an English pound, free on board.</p>

<p>Of the oil of roses, there is, properly speaking, only one
genuine quality, with only little difference in odor, but with
remarkable variation in the facility with which it congeals, which
property is almost generally considered an essential proof of
its being genuine, but without reason; as we have ascertained by
much experience, during a long sojourn in the country where
it is produced. Several reasons may contribute to this difference
in congealing, but the chief one may be considered,
the difference of soil, and method of preparation. We give
our principal attention to the article, and have founded an establishment
at Kissanlik, where it is chiefly produced, through
which alone we make our purchases, and must do so, in order
to have the attar genuine, as we have experienced, that all
the essence without exception that is sold here, second hand,
is far from pure.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The common method and the one now almost exclusively
adopted of adulterating it, with geranium essence,
may be known <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
to you, and that it really is the most in use, you may conclude,
from the price of the genuine article having been for a long time
much higher at the places of production, than the price of that
which is sold as prime in Europe. This fact has only lately
been noticed in Europe, therefore in the price current of Trieste,
for instance, you will find the genuine article noted, beside the
prime article, with a considerable difference of price. What
at London is designated as prime quality, is only a mixture of
60 to 70 per cent. essence of rose, with 30 to 40 per cent. essence
of geranium. Samples will also prove this to you, more clearly.
The price of the genuine attar is, to-day,
<span class="nowrap">22&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>&#xfeff;c.</span>
for an ounce, at
10 drachms, according to which the English price current may
be understood; in six or eight weeks after the preparation of
the new crop, we hope to buy cheaper, but at what rate we
cannot yet judge, as this depends on the produce of the crop.
There is some cheaper and adulterated, and which is only
bought by ignorant persons. This oil comes by caravans from
the interior of Asia, and in spite of all our inquiries, we could
not succeed in getting any sure information, about the plant
which produces it, or the method of preparation.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>ON CHLOROFORM AS A SOLVENT.
<span class="hsmall">BY M. P. H. LEPAGE, OF GISORS.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Hitherto, attention has been mainly directed to the manufacture
of chloroform, and the study of its anesthetic properties.
Many chemists, however, have casually noticed the power it
possesses of dissolving essential oils, fixed fatty matters, camphor
resins, (even those which dissolve with difficulty in alcohol and
ether, such as copal resin, for example,) iodine, bromine, vegetable
alkalies, india rubber insoluble in alcohol, and but slightly
soluble in ether, and, finally, gutta percha, insoluble according
to M. Vogel, in both these menstrua. <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span></p>

<p>Having lately had occasion to experiment with chloroform,
upon a variety of substances, I have thought it might be useful,
with a view to its further application, to make known the results
obtained.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1. Resinous substances, gum mastic, colophony, elemi, balsam
of tolu, benzoin, are very soluble cold, in all proportions
of chloroform and their solutions in this liquid form
varnishes, some of which might, I think, be usefully applied,
when the price of chloroform shall be diminished.</p>

<p>Gum copal and caoutchouc dissolve equally and almost entirely
in this liquid, but more easily hot than cold.</p>

<p>Amber, sandarac, and shellac, are only partially soluble in
chloroform, whether hot or cold. The mixture of sandarac and
chloroform separates into two layers; the lower one which
holds in solution a certain quantity of resin, is fluid, whilst the
upper one is of a gelatinous consistence.</p>

<p>Olibanum dissolves with difficulty in it, either hot or cold.</p>

<p>Gum guaiac and scammony resin, dissolve very easily in
it; whilst on the contrary, pure jalap resin is insoluble; it
becomes soft by contact with the liquid, and then floats on
the top, as a pitch like mass. When the resin is very pure,
the lower layer of chloroform has an amber color.</p>

<p>Gamboge and gum dragon’s blood, also yield some of their
substance to chloroform. The solution of gamboge being of
a magnificent golden yellow, and that of the dragon’s blood
of a beautiful red, these two substances might be advantageously
used as varnishes.</p></li>

<li><p>2. Fixed Fats. Oils of olive, œillettes, almond, ricinus,
cod, rape, euphorbia, lathyris, croton tiglium, lard, tallow,
the concrete oils of palm and cocoa, spermaceti, and probably
all the fixed fats, dissolve remarkably and in all proportions
in chloroform. As to wax, according to M. Vogel,
six or eight parts of chloroform added to one part of this substance
when pure, dissolve only .25, whence this chemist supposes,
that whenever wax treated with this liquid
in the above <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
named proportions, leaves less than .75, it may be considered as
having been mixed with tallow or stearic acid.</p>

<p>I placed in a small tube, seven grammes of chloroform,
and one gramme of <i>pure</i> white wax, shaking the mixture
violently, at the end of six or eight hours the piece of wax had
entirely disappeared, and the contents of the tube resembled
an emulsion. The whole was passed through a filter of the
weight of one gramme. A transparent liquid passed, which,
exposed to spontaneous evaporation, left a residuum of pillular
consistence weighing twenty-five centigrammes; whilst the filter
which retained the portion of undissolved wax, left to the action
of the air, until it no longer lost weight, was found to weigh
one gramme, seventy-five centigrammes. The result of this
experiment therefore, confirms the statement of the learned
chemist of Munich.</p></li>

<li><p>3. Volatile oils. All are soluble in chloroform.</p></li>

<li><p>4. Simple metalloid bodies. We already know that iodine
and bromine are soluble in chloroform, I have further ascertained
that phosphorus and sulphur are slightly so.</p></li>

<li><p>5. Immediate neutral principles. Stryacine, piperine, naphtaline,
cholesterine, are very soluble in chloroform. Pricrotoxine,
slightly so. Parafine will only dissolve when warm, and on
cooling, again floats on the top of the liquid. Amygdaline,
phloridzine, salicine, digitaline, cynisin, urea, hematin, gluten,
sugar, &amp;c., are insoluble in it.</p></li>

<li><p>6. Organic acids. Benzoic and hippuric acids are very
soluble in chloroform. Tannin is but slightly soluble, tartaric,
citric, oxalic and gallic acids are insoluble in it.</p></li>

<li><p>7. Organic alkalies. Quinine, pure veratrine, emetine and
narcotine are easily soluble in chloroform. Strychnine dissolves
pretty well in it, and the solution, even when not saturated
(one décigramme to two grammes of chloroform, for instance,)
deposits, in twenty-four hours, a number of little tuberculiform
crystals, which may perhaps be a modification of this
alkaloid (an isomeric state), for their solution in dilute acids has
appeared to me less bitter, and less easily
precipitable by <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
ammonia than that of ordinary strychnine. Brucine is also quite
soluble in chloroform. Morphine and cinchonine are insoluble.</p></li>

<li><p>8. Salts of organic acids. Tartar emetic, the acetates of
potash and soda, lactate of iron, citrate of iron, valerianate of
zinc, and acetate of lead do not dissolve in chloroform.</p></li>

<li><p>9. Salts with organic bases. Sulphate and hydrochlorate of
strychnine, are tolerably soluble in chloroform, whilst sulphate
of quinine, hydrochlorate and sulphate of morphine are
insoluble.</p></li>

<li><p>10. Haloid salts. Iodide and bromide of potassium, the
chlorides of sodium, potassium and ammonia, the iodides of
mercury and lead, the yellow prussiate of potash, the cyanides
of mercury and potassium do not dissolve in chloroform. Chloride
of mercury is very soluble.</p></li>

<li><p>11. Oxysalts. The iodates, chlorates, nitrates, phosphates,
sulphates, chromates, borates, arseniates and alkaline hyposulphates
are completely insoluble in chloroform. The same
may be said of nitrate of silver, sulphate of copper, and probably
of all the metallic oxysalts.</p></li></ul>

<p>The above facts prove: 1st That chloroform dissolves, with
a very few exceptions, all bodies soluble in ether; but as it dissolves
copal, caoutchouc, &amp;c., much better than this latter substance,
this property will become serviceable when the price of
chloroform shall be lowered.</p>

<p>2nd. That contrary to what was formerly believed, it dissolves
shellac much less easily than alcohol.</p>

<p>3rd. That it may be employed instead of ether, to separate
quinine from cinchonine, narcotine from morphine, guaiac resin
from jalap resin, which substances are often found mixed together
in commerce.</p>

<p>4th. That it dissolves in large proportions strychnine, brucine,
and emetine, alkaloids, which are almost insoluble in ether.</p>

<p>5th. Finally, that it does not dissolve tartaric, citric, oxalic
and gallic acids, amygdaline, phloridzine, salicine, digitaline,
hematine, gluten, &amp;c., all which bodies are
soluble in alcohol, <span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span>
nor the chlorides, bromides, iodides, or nitrates, salts, all soluble
in the same vehicle.</p>

<p>I think it right also to add the following observation, because
it tends to corroborate a fact recently stated in the <i>Journal de
Chimie Médicale</i>, by my friend and former colleague, M.
Aujendre, assayer at the mint of Constantinople, namely that
chloroform possesses antiseptic properties. Having accidentally
left in a half filled, but corked bottle, during a month (from
April 10, to May 12), in my laboratory, where the variations of
temperature are very frequent, some milk mixed with about
a hundredth part of chloroform, I was rather surprised, on examining
the milk, to find that it had preserved the fluidity and
homogeneity of the liquid when freshly drawn, and that it could
even be boiled without turning.—<i>Journal de Chimie Médicale

of the Phil­a­del­phia Coll. of Pharm.</i>)</span></h3></div>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The joint Committees of the Philadelphia County Medical
Society, and of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, appointed
for the purpose of considering the means best adapted
to prevent the occurrence of mistakes in the compounding of
the prescriptions of Physicians by Apothecaries, beg leave to
report that they have given to the subject all the attention that
its importance demands, and present the following hints as the
results of their joint deliberations. They have taken the liberty
of adding, also, a few general hints on the relations that should
exist between physicians and phar­ma­ceu­tists.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<div><span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span></div>

<h4>A. <i>In Respect to Physicians.</i></h4>

<p>1. Physicians should write their prescriptions carefully and
legibly, making use of good paper, and, whenever possible, of
pen and ink. When obliged to write with a pencil, they should
take the precaution to fold the prescription twice, so as to prevent
its being defaced.</p></div>

<p>2. The nomenclature of the United States Pharmacopœia is
becoming annually more in favor with phar­ma­ceu­tists; a statement
attested by the fact that 1500 copies of the book of Latin
Labels for shop furniture, published by the Philadelphia College
of Pharmacy, have been disposed of within three years.
Physicians are also becoming more alive to the merits of our
national Codex, and they are respectfully urged to familiarize
themselves with its nomenclature, and to adhere to it strictly
in their prescriptions.</p>

<p>3. The numerous treatises on Materia Medica, Pharmacy
and the Practice of Medicine, of English origin, that are reprinted
in this country, not­with­stand­ing they are generally interlarded
with the formulæ of our own Pharmacopœia, tend,
nevertheless, very much to confuse the physician and apothecary,
in the use and exact meaning of terms in prescriptions.
To obviate the difficulties thus occasioned, the physician
should, when he prescribes a medicine, which is not officinal,
nor in common use, state on his prescription, either in a note
at the bottom, or within parenthesis, following the article, the
authority or work from whence it is derived, as “Griffith’s
Formulary,”—“Ellis’ Formulary,”—“Braithwaite’s Retrospect,”
etc.</p>

<p>4. Physicians would lessen the risk of errors in their prescriptions,
and increase the chances of their detection should
they be made, by observing the following hints.</p>

<p>1st. Write the name of the patient at the top of the prescription,
unless a good reason prevents this being done; in which
case, it should be expressed as for Mr. G—, Mrs. R—, or Mrs.
S.’s child, or for Master T—, so as to convey to the apothecary
some idea of the age
of the patient. <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span></p>

<p>2d. The date and name of the physician or his initials, should
always be appended, and, whenever practical, the dose and
mode of administering the medicine directed.</p>

<p>3d. When an unusually large dose of an active medicine is
prescribed, as opium, morphia, elaterium, strychnia, etc., let
such names be put in <i>italics</i>, and the quantity or quantities repeated
in writing enclosed within a parenthesis; thus:—R
Morphiæ Sulphatis grs. vj. (six grains.) Div. in chart. vj.</p>

<p>4th. When an active substance is to be used externally, it
should be so stated on the prescription; thus, “For external
application”—“To be applied to the part as directed,” etc.</p>

<p>5th. The quantities of each article should be placed in a line
with the name, and not below it and in using the Roman
numerals, the <i>i</i>’s should be dotted correctly.</p>

<p>6th. The occasional practice of writing the directions intended
for the patient in <i>latin</i>, and especially in abbreviated latin,
is uncalled for, and attended with some risk; it is far safer to
write them in English, and without abbreviation or the use of
figures, unless these are well and distinctly formed.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h4>B. <i>In Respect to the Apothecary.</i></h4>

<p>1st. The apothecary should hesitate to dispense a prescription,
the handwriting of which is so imperfect as to render the
writer’s meaning doubtful—especially if it involves agents of a
poisonous or irritating character—unless he is able, from collateral
circumstances, to satisfy himself of the intent of the prescriber.
In such a case he should delay the delivery of the
medicine to the patient until he can see the physician, and in
doing so he should avoid committing the latter, by agreeing to
send the medicine when it is ready.</p></div>

<p>2d. The apothecary is justified in the same means of delay,
if he, after deliberate consideration, believes that the physician
has inadvertently made a mistake in the quantity or dose of the
article or articles prescribed; always keeping in view the physician’s
reputation as well as his own. Every respectful application,
in such cases, to a physician, should be met
in good faith <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
and with kind feeling, even though no error should prove to
exist.</p>

<p>3d. In his demeanor and language, the apothecary should
cautiously avoid compromising the physician, unless it be unavoidable,
in which case honesty is the best policy, and the
patient or his messenger should be told that it will be necessary
to have an interview with the physician previously to compounding
his prescription.</p>

<p>4th. The apothecary is not justifiable in making inquiries relative
to the patient or his disease, or remarks relative to the
character or properties of the medicines prescribed, that are
uncalled for, or likely to convey a wrong impression, through
an ignorant messenger, to the patient, excepting it be done in
a case where he has doubts in regard to the prescription, and
wishes to satisfy himself, and here he should act with great
discreetness.</p>

<p>5th. When an apothecary is asked his opinion of a physician’s
prescription in a manner that indicates want of faith in
the prescriber, he should waive the question, unless by a direct
answer he should be able to restore that confidence. When
asked the nature of the ingredients, he should be guided in his
answer by circumstances, avoiding to give the desired information,
when he believes it would be contrary to the wish of the
physician, or attended with injurious consequences. In other
cases he should use his own judgment.</p>

<p>6th. Physicians being often unacquainted with practical
pharmacy, pay little attention to the order in which the several
articles entering into a prescription are arranged, with the view
to facilitate the operations of dispensing. It hence becomes
the first duty of the apothecary carefully to read the prescription
and fix the proper order in his mind. He should, at the
same time, acquire the habit of considering the quantities
ordered in relation to the usual doses, and, also, the general
bearing of the prescription; and a constant resort to this practice,
based on due knowledge, must almost inevitably detect
mistakes, if any have been made. <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span></p>

<p>7th. Apothecaries should accustom their assistants to study
prescriptions in this light, and to acquire such a knowledge of
the doses and therapeutical uses of medicines as shall serve to
guide them in avoiding errors.</p>

<p>8th. The apothecary, when engaged in dispensing a prescription,
should, as far as possible, avoid mental preoccupation, and
give his attention fully to his task. He should acquire the
habit of <i>always</i> examining the label of the bottle before using
its contents, and he should satisfy himself that he has read the
prescribed quantity correctly, by referring to the prescription
anew before weighing out each article. It is also, a useful
precaution to have bottles containing mineral or vegetable
poisons, distinguished by some prominent mark.</p>

<p>9th. As the conscientious discharge of his duty should be
the aim of every apothecary, seeing that on his correct action
depends, in no slight degree, the usefulness of the physician,
no pains should be spared to secure the efficiency of the medicines
dispensed, whether they be drugs or preparations. The
latter should always be prepared of full strength, and according
to the formulæ recognized by the United States Pharmacopœia,
unless when otherwise specially ordered.</p>

<p>10th. The apothecary should always label, and number correctly,
all medicine dispensed by him on the prescription of a
physician; he should, also, invariably, transcribe on the label,
in a plain legible hand writing, the name of the patient, the
date of the prescription, the directions intended for the patient,
and the name or the initials of the prescriber.</p>

<p>11th. The original prescription should always be retained
by the apothecary, whose warrantee it is, in case of error on
the part of the prescriber. When a copy is requested, if, as in
many instances, no objection can be urged, it should be a <i>fac
simile</i> in language and symbols, and not a translation.</p>

<p>12th. In no instance is an apothecary justifiable in leaving
his business in charge of boys, or incompetent assistants—or
in allowing such to compound prescriptions, excepting under
his immediate and careful supervision. <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span></p>

<p>13th. In justice to his sense of the proper limits of his vocation,
to the medical profession, and to his customers, the apothecary
should abstain from prescribing for diseases, excepting
in those emergencies, which occasionally occur, demanding immediate
action, or, in those every day unimportant cases where
to refuse council would be construed as a confession of ignorance,
calculated to injure the reputation of the apothecary,
and would be attended with no advantage to either physician
or patient.</p>

<p>14th. The sale of quack or secret medicines, properly so
called, constitutes a considerable item in the business of some
apothecaries. Many of the people are favorably impressed towards
that class of medicines, and naturally go to their apothecaries
for them. It is this which has caused many apothecaries
to keep certain of these nostrums, who are ready and willing
to relinquish the traffic in them, but for the offence that a refusal
to supply them to their customers would create. At present
all that the best disposed apothecary can be expected to
do, is to refrain from the manufacture himself, of quack and
secret medicines; to abstain from recommending them, either
verbally or by exhibiting show bills, announcing them for sale,
in his shop or windows; and to discourage their use, when
appealed to.</p>

<p>15th. Having in view the welfare of the community and the
advancement of pharmaceutic science and interest, it is all important
that the offices of prescribing and compounding medicines
should be kept distinct, in this city and surrounding districts.
All connection with, or moneyed interest in apothecary
stores, on the part of physicians, should, therefore, be discountenanced.
With respect to the pecuniary understanding said
to exist, in some instances, between apothecaries and physicians,
we hold, that no well disposed apothecary or physician
would be a party to such contract, and consider the code of
Ethics of the College of Pharmacy and the Constitution of the
Philadelphia County Medical Society as sufficiently explicit on
this subject. <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span></p>

<p>16th. In reference to the patronage on the part of Physicians
of particular apothecaries, we are of opinion, as a general rule,
that Graduates in Pharmacy should be encouraged in preference
to others of the same date of business, and whilst admitting
the abstract right of the physician to send his prescription
where he pleases, we think that justice should dictate the propriety
of his encouraging the nearest apothecary deserving of
his confidence and that of the patient.</p>

points, however, we differ from the author of the report. We do not
think (B. Article 4th,) that the apothecary is ever justified in making
inquiries relative to the disease of a patient. If his very inquiries
may “convey a wrong impression to the patient, through an ignorant
messenger,” how can that ignorant messenger give information regarding
the disease of a patient, which can guide the apothecary, himself not
supposed to be versed in therapeutics, in judging of the correctness
of a prescription? The apothecary, where he is in doubt, may inquire
the dose and the age of the patient, and then, if he deems necessary,
may have recourse to the physician himself. And in regard to the next

NOTE ON THE DIVISION OF GUM RESINS IN
POTIONS, AND IN DIACHYLON PLAISTER.</h3></div>
</div><!--section-->

<p>At a recent meeting of the Society of Pharmacy, M. Poulenc,
submitted a method which he has employed for eight years in
his laboratory, for suspending gum resins in medical prescriptions.
It is well known how much difficulty there is in suspending
either in a mixture, or lotion, one or more grammes of
gum ammoniac, assafœtida, myrrh, &amp;c. In
dividing the <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
assafœtida with yolk of egg alone, the manipulation is long; but if
instead of the egg, we employ 6 or 8 drops of oil of sweet
almonds per gramme, the gum resin, even when entire, is
easily reduced; when the oil is well mixed, and the paste as
homogeneous as possible, a little water is first added, then gradually
the quantity of the prescribed vehicle, as for the mucilage
of a linctus; the product of this operation will be a speedy and
very perfect emulsion. One of the advantages of this <i>modus
faciendi</i>, is, that the product can be warmed without danger of
coagulation, besides which, it is generally more easy to obtain
a few drops of oil of sweet almonds, or any other kind of oil
than the yolk of an egg.</p>

<p>M. Poulenc has recently applied the same method to the
manufacture of diachylon plaister, in the following manner: take
some entire pieces of gum resin, and triturate them briskly in
an iron mortar, after which in a marble, or porcelain mortar,
mix in the oil, and add a sufficient quantity of water to obtain
an emulsion about as thick as liquid honey; strain this through
a coarse cloth; there will be hardly anything left on the cloth,
and the strained substance will be perfectly homogeneous.
Evaporate in an earthen vessel, by the water-bath, the water
which had been mixed in, and when the mass presents the appearance
of a soft extract, the other ingredients of the plaister
may be mixed in with the greatest ease. This plaister presents
a very beautiful appearance, and exhales a very decided odour
of the gum resins employed in its composition. Should it be
feared that the small quantity of oil, might weaken the consistence
of the plaister, M. Poulenc thinks that the quantity of
turpentine might, without inconvenience, be slightly diminished.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>We have tried with success the method of M. Poulenc for
emulsions with gum resins; as to its further use in the preparation
of diachylon plaister, we cannot speak with certainty.—There
is a chemical question, which, in all cases governs the preparation
of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal agents.—<i>Stan. Martin, L’Abeille

</div><!--section-->

<p>The liquid sold under this name, and which has been for some
time in use by confectioners, is the <i>acetate of the oxide of amyle</i>.</p>

<p>It is prepared with great facility by submitting to distillation
a mixture of one part of amylic alcohol (better known by the
name of oil of grain,) two parts of acetate of potash, and one
part of oil of vitriol. The distilled liquid is to be washed with
alkaline water, dehydrated by chloride of calcium, and afterwards
rectified by distillation from protoxide of lead.</p>

<p>Its properties are thus stated by Dumas:—In the state of
purity it is a colorless, very limpid, volatile liquor, which boils
at 257° F. It possesses an ethereal aromatic odor, somewhat
resembling acetic ether; its sp. gr. is less than that of water.
It is insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol, ether, oil of
grain, &amp;c. Concentrated sulphuric acid does not color it in the
cold; but by heating the mixture, it becomes reddish-yellow,
and when the temperature is elevated, destructive reaction
takes place, the mixture blackens and evolves sulphurous acid.
Placed in contact with a watery solution of potash it is very
slowly altered; but an alcoholic solution of this base rapidly
decomposes, an alkaline acetate is formed, and the oil of grain
regenerated. Its ultimate composition is</p>

immersing them in the gases; next, that the combined atmospheres
were too much saturated with moisture, often causing
rapid growth and decay; and that these flowers and roots should
be compared with others grown in similar volumes of confined
common air. Prof. Dumas spoke of the great, and, indeed,
almost unsuspected influence of carbonic oxide gas. The judicial
investigations in France had disclosed the fatal effects of
this gas as being so much greater than carbonic acid gas. In
the atmosphere produced by the burning of charcoal, 1-200th

<p>On reading this bill, carelessly, we thought that it was intended to be levelled
at nostroms and quack medicines. If it were so, however laudable the motives
of its originators, its policy is much to be doubted. The public are not prepared
for it; it would, at once, raise a clamour about selfish motives and private interests;
it would never be enforced: and would tend to bring more moderate
and judicious legislation into contempt. But a careful perusal of the bill shows
that it applies to Apothecaries and venders of medicines in the ordinary prosecution
of their business. Should it become a law, no Apothecary could sell six
cents worth of paregoric, or an ounce of spiced syrup of rhubarb, unless he accompanies
the article sold with a detailed enumeration of the substances composing
it, with the proportions of each “written or printed in the English language,”
without rendering himself liable to fine and imprisonment! It is not
necessary to characterize such a law to Druggists. It is worthy of notice, however,
as an instance of that spirit of pseudo reform which is at present so rampant.
As a general rule, we believe, Physicians have no objection to their
patients knowing the remedies they prescribe, particularly when the patients
themselves are people of sense and information, but in many instances, of what

out the ingredients of a prescription? Would it help them to a knowledge of its

which of the twenty trivial names, that in different times and different places

strictly the modern chemical nomenclature, or should we take that of a few
years back or should we go to the fountain head and return to the names of the
old Alchemists? The whole matter is unworthy serious comment.</p>

<p>The Cavendish Society was instituted for the promotion of Chemistry, and its
allied sciences, by the diffusion of the literature of these subjects. The society
effects its object by the translation of recent works and papers of merit; by the
publication of valuable original works which would not otherwise be printed,
from the slender chance of their meeting with a remunerative sale, and by the
occasional republication or translation of such ancient or earlier modern works,
as may be considered interesting or useful to the members of the Society.</p>

<p>Heretofore persons in this country were admitted to membership on application
to Mr. Redwood the general Secretary of the Society, at London. To facilitate
communication between the Society and its American members, the undersigned
has been appointed <i>Local Secretary</i>, at Philadelphia, and to whom application
should be made. The payment of five dollars U. S. Currency or its equivalent,
annually, entitles each member to a copy of every work published by the
Society for the period during which their membership continues. No member
shall be entitled to the Society’s publications unless his annual subscription shall
have been duly paid, and it is to be understood that the charges for duty and
freight on the books arising from their shipment to this country are to be paid
to the Secretary on delivery.</p>

<p>The number of Works published will necessarily depend on the number of
annual subscribers; hence it is of great importance to the individual interest of
the members that their aggregate number should be large. The Society now
issue two or three volumes yearly. The books are handsomely printed on a uniform
plan, for members only, their publication being conducted by the Council
who are elected annually by Ballot from among the members; every member
having a vote.</p>

<p>Members by subscribing for all or any of the past years, may get the works
issued during those years except the first volume, published by the Society in
1848, entitled “Chemical reports and Memoirs by Thomas Graham, F. R. S.”

<h3>ON THE HEAVY OIL OF WINE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY EDWARD N. KENT.</span></h3>

<p>Having occasion to use a little of the officinal oil of wine, I
applied to one of our wholesale Druggists, who furnished me
with an article, which I found to be useless. On testing a
sample, it <i>mixed with water</i> and produced a slight milkiness.
It was evidently alcohol, containing a trace only of oil. The
price of this was $4 per pound.</p>
</div><!--chapter-->

<p>Samples were then obtained from all of the wholesale Druggists
from whom it could be procured, and each of these was
proved to be equally worthless, as the results of the following
tests will show.</p>

<p>The second sample, when agitated with water, separated into
two portions, one of which was aqueous and the other ethereal.
The latter exposed to the air, to separate the ether by spontaneous
evaporation, left a residue which was completely <i>soluble</i>
in water, and proved to be alcohol. The price of this mixture
of alcohol and ether was $4,50 per pound.</p>

<p>The third sample when agitated with water, became slightly
turbid, and was dissolved. It had a pale yellow color, ethereal
odor, and the sp. gr. was .909. A portion of it, exposed twelve
hours to spontaneous evaporation in a graduated measure, lost
one-eighth of its bulk, and on the application of a taper, burned
with a <i>blue</i> flame. It is quite evident that this also was alcohol
with a small portion of ether, and a trace of
oil. The price <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
of this was $4,50 per pound, and it was labelled “Ol. Aetherii.”
It bore also the name of the <i>importers</i>.</p>

<p>The fourth sample, when agitated with water, became slightly
turbid, and dissolved. It was colorless, had an ethereal odor,
and the sp. gr. was .844. This also burned with a <i>blue</i> flame.
The price of this worthless article was $6,50 per pound. It
was labelled “Ol. Vini Pur,” and bore also the name of the
<i>London</i> manufacturer.</p>

<p>It may be well to remark, that the officinal oil of wine, when
agitated with water, separates and falls to the bottom, being
heavier than water, whence its name. The sp. gr. of the pure
oil is not less than 1.05, and it has a yellow color.</p>

<p>The labels on the third and fourth samples above mentioned,
are alone not sufficient evidence to prove that they were <i>imported</i>,
but, in addition to the label, I was informed that one of
them <i>was recently imported</i>, and also that the manufacturing
Chemists in this country do not make or sell the oil of wine.—In
view of this statement (if true) the question naturally arises:
How did the above worthless articles pass the Custom House
under the existing law for “the prevention of the importation
of spurious and adulterated drugs?”</p>

<p>I have examined another sample which is not offered for sale
as oil of wine, but as it has properties resembling more nearly
the officinal oil than either of the four samples above mentioned,
it might possibly be confounded with the oil of wine. This
sample had an agreeable <i>vinous odor</i>, and a <i>yellow</i> color.—When
agitated with water a considerable quantity of oil separated,
which was <i>lighter</i> than water. A portion of the original
oil, distilled in a glass retort with a thermometer passed through
a cork, inserted into the tubulare, gave about half its bulk of a
colorless liquid below 180º F., which proved to be alcohol containing
a small quantity of acetic ether and œnanthic ether.—The
residue left in the retort had the properties of a mixture of
œnanthic ether and œnanthic acid. The above article has been,
extensively used (in connection with acetic ether)
for the <span class="xxpn" id="p067">{67}</span>
manufacture of factitious brandy, and is sold for about $1,50 per
ounce.</p>

<p>After having tested samples of all the different articles offered
for sale under the name of “oil of wine” by the wholesale
Druggists in New York, without being able to find either
of them worthy of the name, I prepared a little for my own
use, by the following process, which is that of the London
Pharmacopœia:</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">2 lbs.</span>
oil of vitriol were carefully mixed with <span class="nowrap">1 lb.</span>
commercial
alcohol, and distilled very slowly in a glass retort. The
product consisted of two portions, the lightest of which was an
ethereal solution of oil of wine measuring <span class="nowrap">6 oz.</span>
This was exposed
to the air for twenty-four hours to remove the ether by
spontaneous evaporation. The residue, washed with a little
dilute solution of potash and dried, was pure “Heavy Oil of
Wine,” and weighed half an ounce. The quantity obtained,
though small, corresponds exactly with the proportion obtained
by Hennell at the Apothecaries’ Hall, London, viz: <span class="nowrap">17 oz.</span>
oil of
wine from <span class="nowrap">34 lbs.</span>
alcohol, and <span class="nowrap">68 lbs.</span>
oil of vitriol.</p>

<p>By a simple calculation of the cost of manufacture, and expense
of importation, it will be seen that pure oil of wine could
not be imported and sold at the prices asked for the samples
above mentioned. In making this calculation it will be necessary
to observe that under the existing excise law, the price
of alcohol in England is much higher than in the United States,
and is now, I am informed, from 17 to 18 shillings sterling per
gallon. The following calculation (based on the results of Hennell’s
process) gives the cost of <i>pure</i> oil of wine, manufactured
in England and imported into this country, at $35 per pound;
but the spurious articles now sold for oil of wine, are offered at
prices varying from $4 to $6,50 per pound.</p>

<p>I regret that I have been unable to find the price of pure oil
of wine quoted in the lists of any of the manufacturing chemists,
but think it fair to infer that if the article is offered for
sale, of English manufacture, at less than $2 per ounce, that impurity
or adulteration may be suspected, and in this case, I
would recommend the following process for testing its purity.</p>

<p>Agitate a small portion of the oil in a test tube, with an
equal measure of water. If it dissolves, reject the sample as
impure, but if the mixture separates into two portions, after
standing at rest for a few moments, put it on a paper filter,
previously well moistened with water. The water in the mixture
will pass through the moistened filter, leaving ether or oil
upon it. If this is colorless or very pale yellow, it should be
exposed a few hours to spontaneous evaporation, to ascertain
if it contains oil. But if it is yellow and heavier than water,
this portion may consist of oil of wine; this, however, should be
verified by observing the odor and sp. gr. of the oil. By carefully
operating upon a <i>known</i> quantity in the above manner,
the <i>proportion</i> of alcohol or ether (if present) may be easily
determined.</p>

<p>As the efficacy of Hoffman’s Anodyne is due to the heavy
oil of wine contained in it, and as the proportion of this oil to
the other constituents is small, it is
particularly necessary that <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
the oil should be pure. The high price of alcohol in England,
and a defect in the directions formerly given for its preparation
in the United States Dispensatory, are the probable causes
of the absence of pure oil of wine in New York. In recent editions
of the above work, the defective proportions have been
substituted by those of the London college, and there is now
no reason why pure oil of wine should not be made in the United
States, where alcohol is cheaper, probably, than in any
other part of the world. I hope that our manufacturing chemists
will turn their attention to this subject, and displace all
worthless chemical and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal preparations by such
as will be useful to the public, and creditable to the manufacturers.</p>

part of alcohol, and gives 1.096 as the sp. gr. of the oil.]—<span

<h3>PRACTICAL HINTS,
<span class="hsmall">
BY A WHOLESALE DRUGGIST.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The prosecution of the business of preparing and vending
medicines, has been and still is too exclusively confined to the
dollar and cent department.</p>

<p>Buyers take too much for granted. Ipecac is Ipecac all the
world over, and he who can sell Ipecac at the lowest price is
likely to sell the most and make the most money. To the credit
of the craft, in part however, a manifest improvement in this
respect, has taken place within the last few years, to their
credit in part, I say, because the demand for good medicines
has of late increased, <i>compelling</i> some druggists to furnish
better qualities than they otherwise would.</p>

<p>It is a common remark that the late law, passed by Congress,
relating to the introduction or importation of adulterated and
inferior drugs, has produced a more desirable state
of things in <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
our community, by opening the eyes of consumers to the fact that
inferior drugs are imported and are consumed. This is only in
part true. An improved state of public opinion first caused
the law to be passed; this, in connection with the law when
passed, caused a further progress. The stone, thus set in motion,
will no doubt roll on till an entire revolution takes place
both with venders and consumers.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that the person who swallows a dose of
medicine dreams that it is not of good quality, or that he would
hesitate in the value of six cents when purchasing his dose, between
the best of its kind and that which is comparatively inert.
The root of this great evil, viz: the purchasing, selling,
and administering inferior medicines is <i>ignorance</i>. The patient
can have little or no knowledge of the efficacy of what is given
to him to take, and to the shame of a large portion of the medical
profession be it spoken, the doctor knows but little more.
I speak with confidence when I say that the knowledge of the
sensible properties of drugs is almost exclusively confined to
the druggist and apothecary. Hence in the purchase of his supplies
of medicines of the apothecary, the only guide the physician
has, is the price and the word of the seller,—this ought
not so to be. At this time I do not profess to offer a remedy.
The object of the present communication is to offer a few practical
hints to the druggist, connected with the purchase of his
stock; many, if not all, desire to purchase reliable medicines,
but from want of knowledge between good and bad have only
the price, and the reputation of the seller to guide them.</p>

<p>I now propose to take up articles of general use, and suggest
a few simple tests of their quality and condition, which any one
can apply with such means as an ordinary drug store furnishes.</p>

<p>Before proceeding with this subject, however, I beg leave to
urge upon every druggist and apothecary, the great importance
of having, at his disposal, a set of reliable hydrometers
for liquids heavier and lighter than water, and a properly
constructed thermometer for determining the temperature of
liquids. He will find them his right hand helps,
not only for <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
detecting adulterations, but for determining the strength or
quality of nearly all the liquids which come under his inspection.</p>

<p>Certain arbitrary terms have been applied to solutions of
ammonia and ethers, such as F.; F.&#160;F.; F.&#160;F.&#160;F.; and so on.
These terms were originally intended to indicate the exact
strength of those liquids to which they were applied; but, unfortunately,
every manufacturer has a standard of his own, indicating
the value of an F, or in other words these terms mean
nothing, and should be banished from the books of every intelligent
dealer. The hydrometer will determine the strength
accurately and beyond all question, the dealer therefore should
make his purchases, estimating the strength by the specific
gravity either in decimals or degrees.</p>

<p>In detecting adulterations of essential oils, the Hydrometer
is invaluable. If the specific gravity of an oil does not accord
with the standard, it is proof positive that the oil is not pure;
the reverse, however, is not so clear. If the specific gravity
does accord with the standard, it is not a positive proof that
it is pure, for the reason that the adulteration may be of the
same specific gravity as the oil itself.</p>

<p>The strength of acids such as muriatic, nitric, sulphuric,
aqua fortis, and the like, is accurately determined by this
means.</p>

<p>A set of these instruments, on which dependence may be
placed, can be obtained at a price varying from $5 to $12.</p>

<p>Let the dealer apply these instruments (where applicable) to
all his purchases, and he will soon find out what he sells and
who deals honestly by him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M<b>AGNESIA</b></span>
<span class="smcap">(C<b>ALCINED</b>).</span>
Nearly all that is used in this country
is imported from England. The quality, not­with­stand­ing
the drug law, is usually quite inferior. The impurities generally
are carb. magnesia, lime, alumina and silica.</p>

<p>To detect carb. magnesia, put into a vial a small portion, and
add two or three times its bulk of water; after mixing them
well, add a small portion of sulphuric acid—effervesence will
indicate the presence of a carbonate. On the addition
of an <span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span>
excess of acid, the solution should be perfectly clear; whatever is
deposited is impurity of some kind; if lime is present an insoluble
sulphate is formed.</p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The presence of moisture is indicated by the magnesia being
lumpy, and when shaken, the particles do not flow among
themselves easily. Good magnesia has a light, lively appearance,
and is pearly
white.—<span class="nowrap">(<span class="smmaj">TO BE CONTINUED.</span>)</span></p>

<h3>ON BLISTERING CERATE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY EUGENE DUPUY, PARMACEUTIST, NEW YORK.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The successful researches of Robiquet in his labors on the
Cantharis Vesicatoria, have demonstrated that the cristallisable
neutral substance to which he gave the name of <i>Cantharidine</i>,
is the proximate epispastic principle of the blistering cerate
on which the physician depends in most cases, where an extended
and yet deep revulsive action is necessary, whether it is derived
from the cantharis vesicatoria or from other members of the
trachelid family. The experiments of Mess. Lavini &amp; Sobrero
of Turin, have confirmed the supposition made by analogy, of
the indentity which exists in the vesicating principle of all these
coleopters, and there is a strong presumption that our commerce
will soon be enriched with the beautiful cantharis, (C.
nutalli,) abounding in the midst of our rising South Western
States, and that it will eventually supersede the cantharis vesicatoria
we obtain from abroad. If adulteration would not
destroy, by its baneful influence, the advantageous form of complex
extracts, we could obtain a desirable amelioration of our
officinal cerate, by substituting for the powdered cantharides
an equivalent proportion of the oleaginous liquid, with which
they are saturated in the fresh state, and which is possessed of
all the vesicating properties of the insect. That liquid is prepared
in various parts of the Sardinian kingdom, especially at
Verceil, where it is extensively used by veterinary surgeons in
preference to the preparations from the
powdered insect, it <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
producing deeper revulsion. It is also used, diluted in bland
oleaginous substances for stimulating the activity of feeble
serous exudations. As for the present we have not generally
access to that natural product of the cantharis, we must select
those insects in the best possible conditions, and endeavor to
fix their active principle in such a manner as will diminish the
liability to spontaneous volatilisation of which it is susceptible,
even at ordinary temperature.</p>

<p>I have been for many years in the habit of preparing a blistering
plaster which, I think, has some advantages over our
officinal cerate, because it fixes the volatilisable principle, and
at the same time rather increases than diminishes its energy.</p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>To the officinal plastic mixture in which the powdered
cantharides have been gradually incorporated, I add about 5
per cent of a mixture containing equal parts of strong acetic
acid (prepared by distillation of the acetates of copper or lead),
and pulverised camphor. The acetic acid transforms the cantharidine
into an acetate of the same which is not volatilized at
ordinary temperatures, and the camphor diminishes the symptoms
of strangury which some patients have to endure when
the application of a blistering plaster is resorted to. I also
usually spread the blister on adhesive plaster on account of the
convenient adhesion of that material.</p>

received the great bulk of medicinals imported into this country,
some idea may be formed of the enormous quantity of
spurious opium, jalap root, scammony, iodine, iodide of
potassium, etc. annually introduced from abroad. We find
that in ten months, from July 1848 to April 1849, inclusive,
90,000 pounds of adulterated drugs were rejected at the above
named office. During the years 1848 and ’50, numerous specimens
of adulterated articles were submitted to me for examination
by Dr. Baily the inspector of drugs. From a long list I
may select one as an instance of the impudence exhibited by
foreign manufacturers, in attempting to thrust upon us their
villainous compounds, “as standard articles.” I found a specimen
of iodine, purporting to be pure, to contain 2 per cent. of
non-volatile matter and <i>40 per cent. of water</i>. The solid materials
may be passed over as accidental, but the water is undoubtedly
a fraudulent addition.</p>

<p>Beneficial as the establishment of this office may be in preventing
the admission of any but genuine articles from abroad,
in the present state of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal regulations, it merely
serves as a stimulus to the exercise of ingenuity at <i>home</i>, for
producing those adulterations no longer supplied from the other
side of the water. It is hardly necessary to say that rogues
are to be found in every nation and in every clime, but I am
justified (as I believe) in asserting that the spurious articles, at
present met with in our market, are manufactured by foreigners
whose métier has been destroyed by the passage of the drug
bill. It is positively certain that parties who some years since
conducted a factory in Brussels, from which spurious sulphate of
quinine, sulphate of morphine, narcotine, &amp;c., were palmed
upon the citizens of the United States as genuine, are now at
work in a city not one hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>How is this home adulteration to be met? The appointment
of a home inspector of drugs, whose duty it should be to visit,
from time to time, our apothecaries’ establishments, and to inspect
the quality of the drugs therein, would
be at variance <span class="xxpn" id="p075">{75}</span>
with republican ideas; too much like the excise law of England
so obnoxious to the semi-republican inhabitants of Great Brittain.
This question, however, has been sufficiently discussed
by others more able than myself. The remedy for these abuses
rests with the druggists themselves. Legislative enactments
are useless. The present college of pharmacy which includes
in its list of trustees, some of the leading phar­ma­ceu­tists of
the country, has done much towards elevating the profession.
It is to be hoped that the laws under which they act will be
extended to other states, and that no apothecary, unless duly
licensed by the society, shall have any right to pursue his profession
without the diploma of the college.</p>

<p>It is a matter of congratulation that some houses in this city,
and those doing an extensive business, and of the highest reputation,
have associated with themselves partners possessing a
competent knowledge of chemistry. From these houses nothing
can be obtained which is not up to the standard. Our
apothecaries will find it to their advantage in the end, to employ
persons possessing sufficient knowledge to enable them to
detect adulterations in drugs, and not only that, but to be able
to prepare the most difficult articles.</p>

<p>I shall relate in this paper some instances of <i>home adulterations</i>
which have recently come under my notice. I have been
furnished by retail druggists in the city with several specimens
of the bitartrate of potassa. The results of the examination of
five different specimens are here given:</p>

<p>In numerous examinations made of the bitartrate of potassa
and of the iodide of potassium from foreign sources, I have
never detected in the iodide of potassium more than 15 per cent
of impurities, nor in the bitrate of potassa, as imported from
France, more than 8 per cent. Of course the crude commercial
argol always contains a small amount of tartrate of lime.</p>

<p>In a sample of so called “cod liver oil,” submitted to me
for examination by Professor Davis, of the New York Medical
College, I am unable to detect a single trace
of iodine. The <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>

oil and linseed oil; in fact it contains no cod liver oil whatever.

<h3>ON WOORARA. <span class="htiny">
A NOTE READ TO THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, BY M. U. BERNARD, IN HIS OWN
NAME, AND THAT OF M. PELOUZE.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Woorara is a violent poison, prepared by some of the tribes
inhabiting the forests bordering the Upper Oronoco, the Rio
Negro, and the Amazon.</p>

<p>Although the existence of this poison has been long known,
very vague notions are still entertained regarding its component
parts. Amongst the savages who sell or barter it, its preparation
remains secret; and has only been made known through
their priests or sorcerers. According to Humboldt, woorara is
simply a watery extract of a creeper, belonging to the genus
Strychnia. According to M. M. Boussingault and Roulin, it
contains a poisonous substance, analagous to a vegetable alkali,
woorarine. The information given us by M. Houdet, differs
from that of M. Humboldt only in this respect, that he observes,
before the extract is quite dry, the Indians of Messaya pour on
it a few drops of the venom gathered from the glands of the
most venomous serpents. This last circumstance is important,
as we shall see that the physiological effects
of woorara must <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
cause us to regard its mode of action as entirely analogous to
that of venoms.</p>

<p>Woorara is a solid extract, black, resinous looking, soluble in
water. We shall have occasion hereafter to advert to its chemical
properties. Our attention will now be directed to its physiological
effects when exerted on living animals. Woorara
resembles venom in this, that it can be eaten, that is, taken into
the digestive canal of man and other animals with impunity,
whilst when introduced by puncture under the skin, or in any
other part of the body, its absorption is invariably attended
with fatal results in all animals. This fact we have repeatedly
tested. The action of this poison is instantaneous, when it is
injected directly into the blood vessels. A weak, watery solution
thrown into the jugular vein of a dog or a rabbit, has always
produced sudden death, the animal uttering no cry, nor
manifesting any convulsive agitation. The effect on the whole
organization is electric, and the vital functions are arrested as
by lightning. When introduced under the skin in solution or
in solid fragments, its poisonous action manifests itself more
slowly, and the time is varied by the dose, the size of the animal,
and its species. Other things being equal, birds die
soonest, then the mammalia, and then reptiles; thus, with the
same specimen, birds and mammalia die in a few minutes,
whilst a reptile will survive for several hours. But death is invariably
accompanied by similar, and very remarkable symptoms;
in the first place, when pricked, the animal apparently
feels nothing. If a bird, for example, it flies as usual, and at
the end of a few seconds, when the woorara is very active, it
drops dead without uttering a cry, or appearing to suffer; if it
be a rabbit or a dog, it runs about as usual after the puncture,
without any abnormal symptom, then, after some seconds, as
if fatigued, it lies down, appears to sleep, its respiration stops,
and life is terminated, without a groan or sign of pain. Rarely
do we see even slight contraction of the sub-cutaneous muscles
of the face and body.</p>

<p>On examining immediately after death, the
bodies of <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
animals thus poisoned, we have always observed phenomena
which indicate a complete annihilation of all the properties of
the nervous system. It is generally found that when death
has been sudden, the nerves retain for some time the power of
reaction under the influence of mechanical or chemical excitement;
if a nerve of motion be excited, convulsions supervene
in the muscles to which it leads; if the skin be pinched, it
causes reflex motion. But none of these are observed after
death by woorara. The nerves of the still warm animal, in
whom life has been extinct but a minute, are inert as if it had
been dead and cold for several hours.</p>

<p>Again, in animals poisoned by woorara, the blood is invariably
black, and frequently so changed as to coagulate with difficulty,
and not to become bright on re-exposure to air.</p>

<p>If we compare this effect of woorara with that of the viper,
we shall observe a great analogy between them, varying only
in intensity. We may further remark, that woorara, like the
poison of the viper, may be introduced with impunity into the
intestinal canal. We might be led to suppose from its perfect
innocuousness when introduced into the stomach, that it became
modified, or in a word, digested by the gastric juice, so as to
destroy its deleterious properties. To verify this supposition,
we caused some woorara to be digested in the gastric juice of
a dog, at a temperature of between 38° and 40° of centigrade.
After leaving it for forty-eight hours, we introduced it by
puncture into the veins of some animals, who died with the
before-named symptoms; establishing the fact, that a prolonged
contact with the gastric juice in no way modified its deleterious
properties. This experiment has been repeated in various
ways, and on the separate parts, as well as on the living animal.
We made a dog, in whose stomach we had formed a fistulous
opening, swallow some fragments of woorara mixed with his
food; after a little time we obtained some of his gastric juice,
and on analysis found it to resemble in every respect a solution
of woorara. Thus we have the singular phenomenon of an
animal, carrying in its stomach, harmless to
itself, a liquid <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
which would cause instant death to any others who should be
inoculated with it. Not only did the dog which swallowed the
poison experience no fatal result from it, but its digestion was
not even affected by it; the gastric juice thus mixed retaining
all its digestive properties.</p>

<p>These facts prove that the innocuousness of woorara when
introduced into the stomach, is not attributable to the action of
the gastric juice. The other intestinal liquids, saliva, bile,
pancreatic juice, were attended with similar results, none of
them producing by contact the least difference in the poisonous
effect of woorara.</p>

<p>The explanation of these facts appears to be simply this:
there is a want of absorption of the venomous substance through
the gas­tro-in­test­i­nal mucous membrane. This can be shown
by the following experiment:—Take the fresh gastric mucous
membrane of a dog or rabbit, recently killed; adapt it to an
endosmometer in such a manner that the mucous surface remains
outwards; then plunge the endosmometer containing
sweetened water into a watery solution of woorara, and we
shall find, after two or three hours, that the endosmosis will be
complete. The level will have risen in the endosmometer, and
yet the liquid contained in it will shew no trace of the poison,
as can be proved by inoculating other animals with it.</p>

<p>If the experiment were to last longer, the endosmose of the
poison might take place, but we should then find that the
epithelium which covers its surface, had become changed, and
had permitted the imbibition and endosmosis of the poisonous
principle. This is so true, that if a partially decomposed
membrane should be used instead of a fresh one, the endosmose
of the poisonous principle takes place immediately. On the
living animal, we can establish this property of the intestinal
mucous membrane, and can demonstrate that amongst substances
perfectly soluble in appearance there are some which
when lodged on the surface of the intestinal membrane, may
remain there without being absorbed, or without affecting the
system. The active principle of woorara is
of this kind. <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span></p>

<p>It was necessary to ascertain whether other mucous membranes,
besides those of the digestive organs, were possessed of
this same property with regard to woorara. We have tried it
successively on those of the bladder, the nasal fossæ and the
eyes, and in all we have found an equal resistance to the absorption
of the poisonous principle. An injection of this poison into
the bladder of a dog, was retained six or eight hours, with no
bad effects; but the urine voided after that time had all the
poisonous properties of woorara.</p>

<p>One mucous membrane alone offers a remarkable exception;
it is the pulmonary. This acts, in regard to the absorption of
woorara, precisely like the sub-cutaneous cellular tissue; and
on the introduction of some drops of the poisonous solution into
the air passages, when every precaution is taken, death
takes place as rapidly as when the skin has been punctured.</p>

<p>We readily perceive that this membrane, destined solely for
the passage of the air to accomplish the phenomena of respiration,
possesses a peculiar structure, and is unprovided with that
protecting mucous which lubricates the other membranes communicating
with the exterior. This similarity between the
pulmonary mucous membrane and cellular tissue, supports the
ideas which M. Majendie, long ago, promulgated on the structure
of the lungs.</p>

<p>We shall not expatiate, at present, on the remarkable difference
in the absorbent properties of the various mucous membranes
of the body. We shall have occasion again to revert to
the subject, and shall only state that this fact, in relation to the
absorption of woorara, is not isolated, and that in the intestines,
for example, many active principles, although soluble,
cannot be absorbed, and are consequently forced to act locally,
or as if shut up in a closed vessel.</p>

<p>For the present we will content ourselves with these conclusions:</p>

<p>1st. That woorara acts upon animals in the same manner as venom.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>2nd. That its harmlessness, when injected into the
intestinal <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span> canal, cannot be explained by any change which the
poisonous principle undergoes, but rather by a special property
of the gas­tro-in­tes­ti­nal mucous membrane which resists its
absorption.—<i>Journal de Pharmacie et Chimie.</i></p>

<h3>SUMBUL, OR YATAMANSI.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Sumbul, the name and therapeutical properties of which are
almost unknown to French physicians, appears to have been
employed in India from a very remote period. Pietro Della
Valle, who travelled through the different countries of Asia, in
1623, 1624 and 1625, mentions that sumbul is a root, and not a
stem, although the Arabic word, sumbul, he observes, refers to
the whole plant. It appears that the word sumbul is applied in
India to a plant and portions of a plant, used as a perfume, as
an incense in religious ceremonies, and again, as a medicinal
substance. Sir William Jones thought that the true sumbul
was a species of valerian, known both to the Hindoos and
Brahmins, under the name of yatamansi. But, according to
M. Granville, it appears to be an aquatic umbelliferous plant,
found in the neighborhood of rivers.</p>

<p>It is erroneously asserted that it grows in Hindostan. It is
not found in any part of the Indian territory, occupied by the
English. The plant grows in Bootan and the mountains of
Nepaul; and although large quantities of the dried plant have
been exported, no botanist has yet been able to describe its
char­ac­ter­is­tics from a living specimen. It is said that the native
laws forbid the exportation of a living plant, without an order
from the sovereign.</p>

<p>Sumbul has been described as a mass of roots and leaves of
a greenish color, crumpled and pressed one against the other.
This is an error, and arises from the fact of some having been
first shown at St. Petersburg, which had been
mixed with a <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span>
strong decoction of this substance of a greenish color. Sumbul
appears, on the contrary, under the form of a root, thick, homogeneous,
of two, three, and even four inches in diameter, cut
in pieces of an inch to an inch and a half long, and whose section
presents a fibrous aspect, and a white and yellowish tint. It
is brought from the centre of Asia, to Moscow, via Kiatcha. In
all the good specimens of sumbul, the epidermis, or external covering,
is of a dark shade, approaching to brown; if the color
be strongly marked, it indicates that the plant was old. The
epidermis is very thin, and much wrinkled. The interior substance
is composed of thick, irregular fibres, which may be separated
from one another, after the outer covering is detached,
and which indicate a porous structure, common to aquatic
plants. If, after taking off the outer covering, we make a
transverse cut, we shall perceive an external layer, white and
marbled, and an internal layer, thicker and yellowish. With
a powerful lens we can distinguish transparent points, which
look like grains of fecula.</p>

<p>Two very remarkable physical char­ac­ter­is­tics demand our
attention when we examine this root: first, its perfume, resembling
the purest musk; then the powerful aroma which it
exhales when under mastication. This odor of musk is so
marked, that some had thought it owed this quality to its contact
with musk, in the transportation of drugs from Asia to
Europe; but such an idea is negatived by the fact that sumbul
retains this odor, even when very old; that even when the external
parts have lost it, it continues in the interior; that this
odoriferous principle may be extracted from it by chemical
manipulation; and again, that it has received from botanists
the name of moschus-wurzel or musk-root. Its aromatic taste
is also a distinguishing char­ac­ter­is­tic. The first impression on
the palate is slightly sweet, this is rapidly replaced by a balsamic
flavor, and then by a bitter, but not unpleasant taste.—As
mastication proceeds, the mouth and throat experience a
strong aromatic and pungent taste, and the breath becomes
impregnated with the penetrating odor
of the <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
substance.—This flavor is still more decided in the alcoholic tincture than in
the root.</p>

<p>The chemical analysis of sumbul has occupied several German
chemists, Reinsch, Schnitzlein, Frichinger, and Kalthover.
According to Reinsch, the root of sumbul contains, besides water,
traces of an ethereal oil, two balsamic compounds, (resins) one
soluble in ether, the other in alcohol, wax, aromatic spirit, and a
bitter substance, soluble in water or alcohol. The solution of this
bitter substance, treated with lime, and chloride of sodium, gives
a sediment composed of gum, starch and saline materials. The
perfume appears to be contained in the balsams, and its intensity
is increased by being diluted with water. Finally,
sumbul contains an acid, which Reinsch proposes calling <i>sumbulic
acid</i>.</p>

<p>Kalthover directed his attention further to its phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal
uses, and obtained an alcoholic tincture of a yellowish color,
musky odor, and bitter taste; an ethereal tincture, yellowish,
musky, and of a sharp taste; and a substance resembling
wax, precipitated after repeated decoctions in water.</p>

<p>It appears then, that we may obtain from sumbul for medical purposes,
two tinctures, one alcoholic, the other ethereal, which seem to differ
in their principles, and which may be given in drops alone, or combined
with other medicines; and a bitter extract, soluble in water, which may
be administered in pills. The powdered root may also be given crude, or
in pills.—<i>(Union Médicale) in Journal de Pharmacie et de Chimie.</i></p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p class="padtopc fsz6">[Sumbul
has been used as an anti spasmodic and a nervine; further
investigation is needed however to ascertain its true place in the
Materia Medica. In the mean time it has been imported by one of our
apothecaries, Mr. Delluc, and we may soon hope to learn something
more concerning its effects upon the system.] <span class="smcap">E<b>D.</b></span>

<h3>OBSERVATIONS ON THE STRENGTH OF
TINCTURE OF OPIUM.
<span class="hsmall">
BY A. B. GARROD, M. D.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Professor of Materia Medica at University College,
and Physician to University College Hospital.</p>

<p>As many discrepant statements are to be found in works on
Materia Medica, in various dispensatories, &amp;c. concerning the
strength of the tincture of opium of the London Pharmacopœia,
it may not be either uninstructive or uninteresting at least to
the medical profession, to have the subject brought under notice
and discussion at this society, in order that they may arrive at
some definite conclusion concerning the strength of a preparation
they are in the daily habit of prescribing. If we refer to
the London Pharmacopœia of 1836, we find the following directions
for making the tincture of opium:―</p>

<div class="dpoembox"><ul class="ulin2">
<li class="livs">Take of hard opium powdered, 3 ounces,</li>
<li class="livs">Proof spirit, 2 pints,</li>
<li class="livs">Macerate for fourteen days, and strain.</li></ul>

<p>In the Pharmacopœia of 1851, we are ordered to―</p>
<ul class="ulin2">
<li class="livs">Take of opium powdered, 3 ounces,</li>
<li class="livs">Proof spirit, 2 pints,</li>
<li class="livs">Macerate for seven days, press out,
and strain.</li></ul>
</div><!--dpoembox-->

<p class="pcontinue">The
only difference in the directions being that powdered <i>hard</i>
opium, and digestion for <i>fourteen</i> days, are ordered in the one
case, and simply powdered opium and seven days digestion in
the other. If we look at the authorised edition of the Pharmacopœia
by Mr. Philips of 1836, (and also at the present edition)
we find stated, that the preparation has a deep brownish red
color, possesses the peculiar odor and taste of opium, has sp.
gr. 0.952, and about 19 minims contain 1 grain of opium, which
is said to be proved by the following data: 1st, by evaporating
the tincture, and finding the amount of solid extract left; 2d,
by ascertaining the quantity of opium remaining undissolved.
The conclusion at which Mr. Phillips arrived, viz: that 1 grain
of opium was contained in 19 minims of the Pharmacopœia
tincture, has been copied into most English
works on Materia <span class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span>
Medica, and most medical men have been and are still in the
habit of prescribing the tincture considering it to be of the <i>above</i>
strength. Were Mr. Phillip’s conclusions correct?</p>

<p>With regard to the amount of solid extract left on evaporation
of the tincture, it appears from the experiments of Mr. Allchin,
which are also confirmed by those which I have myself made,
that 19 minims yield about 1 grain of extract; but in these cases
the Turkey opium of commerce must be first exsiccated; and
the tinctures of commerce yield quantities varying from 1 in 19
to 1 in 28 minims of the tincture. Tincture of opium made with
Turkey opium in small masses not previously dried, fl.
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />j. gave
on drying 2.7 of solid residue, or 1 grain in about 22.2 minims.
Tincture of opium made with good Turkey opium, previously
dried and reduced to powder (Pharmacopœia directions) fl. <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />j.
gave on drying—three experiments—3.1, or 1 grain of residue
in 19.3 minims.</p>

<p>If made with opium capable of being reduced to a state of
powder, the average quantity of extract would be about 1 grain
in 20 minims; this proportion would indicate that one-third of
the solid ingredient (opium) is left undissolved, which was found
by Mr. Phillips to be the case. I believe all good specimens
of Turkey opium yield about this amount of residue. An experiment
made within the last week at Mr. Bell’s establishment
gave this result. If then the strength of tincture of opium be
considered to be that indicated by Mr. Phillips, we must assume
that the undissolved portion possesses the same therapeutic
effects as the dissolved portion. Is this correct?</p>

<p>It has been stated by some that morphia can be extracted
from the residuum, and in Dr. Pereira’s <i>Materia Medica</i>, we
find the following observations: “Proof spirit dissolves the same
constituents as water does, but it takes up a larger proportion
of <i>narcotine</i>, <i>resin</i>, <i>oil</i>. I have repeatedly prepared morphia
from the insoluble residue left behind in the preparation of the
tincture.” Again, in Dr. Thomson’s <i>Dispensatory</i> it is stated
that Mr. Brande finds that the whole of the morphia is not taken
up; but is found in no inconsiderable quantity
in the filter. <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
We suspect occasionally <i>narcotine</i> has been taken for <i>morphia</i>,<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanch7">7</a>
and in the cases where <i>morphia</i> has really been found, unless
the residue had been previously washed, an error may have
arisen from the alkaloid being contained in the tincture of
opium adhering to the dregs, and not from any contained in the
residue itself. I have recently endeavoured to ascertain the
true state of the case, and chiefly by means of a therapeutic
inquiry into the strength of the residuum. The residue of
tincture of opium prepared in the ordinary way at University
College Hospital, was taken for experiment; it was first washed
with a little cold water to remove any adhering tincture, and
afterwards dried in a water-bath. By digestion with ether, it
was found to yield abundance of <i>narcotine</i>, and was also found
to contain <i>meconic acid</i> sufficient to strike a claret color with
the persalts of iron; but at the same time nitric acid gave no
evidence of the presence of <i>morphia</i>. It was found also by
experiment that proof spirit at the ordinary temperature dissolved
but a very small portion of narcotine; the bulk of the
narcotine therefore remains in the residuum from the tincture
of opium, perhaps united with meconic acid; for when treated
with water acidulated with acetic acid, both <i>narcotine</i> and
<i>meconic</i> acid were dissolved.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch7" id="fn7">7</a>
In the sixth edition of Dr. Thomson’s <i>Dispensatory</i>,
page 1061, the following method is given for obtaining “meconate of
morphia,” extracted from the <i>Quarterly Journal of Science</i>, vol. xx.,
from which it will be at once observed, that <i>narcotine</i> was mistaken
for crystallized <i>meconate of morphia</i>.</p>

<p>“Reduce good opium to powder, put it into a paper filter, add distilled
water to it, and slightly agitate it; and in this way wash it till the
water passes through colorless, after which, pass a little diluted
alcohol through it; dry the insoluble portion (now diminished to
one-half,) in a dark place; digest it, when dry, in strong alcohol for
a few minutes, applying heat; separate this solution, which by boiling,
and after evaporation, will yield crystallized meconate of morphia of a
pale straw color.”</p></div>

<p>A portion of the residue was given internally; <i>one grain</i> to a healthy
adult produced no effect; <i>two grains</i> were given with no result; the
dose was then successively increased to <i>four grains</i> then to <i>six
grains</i>, afterwards to <i>thirteen</i>, and lastly to <i>thirty grains</i>,
without causing the slightest effect on the individuals to whom it
was administered; the only limitation to the quantity given being the
unpleasantness of taking so large an <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
amount of so bulky a matter. It appears, therefore, that the
residue is, to all intents and purposes, inert.</p>

<p>From these experiments, it is evident that even <i>should</i> traces
of <i>morphia</i> be contained in the dregs, still the quantity must
be such (when the tincture is prepared according to the London
Pharmacopœia) as to make no appreciable diminution of the
strength of the preparation, and that the tinctura opii contains
the active matter of the whole of the drug used in its formation,
and therefore about 12 minims of tincture of opium possesses all
the activity of 1 grain of crude opium, assuming that it loses
only 12 per cent. in the drying. If dry opium is taken for
comparison, 1 grain is contained in about
<span class="nowrap">13&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
minims; and,
therefore, <i>one</i> fluid drachm of tinctura opii contains about 5
grains of the drug, or
<span class="nowrap">4&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
grains (according as it is compared
with the dry or moist opium), in place of 3 grains; or 1 fluid
ounce contains 40 or 36 grains in place of 24 grains usually
assumed to be contained in it: a difference of strength of the
highest importance when we consider the highly poisonous
and powerful therapeutic action of the drug.</p>

<p>In the Edinburgh preparation the amount of tincture containing
a grain of opium is about
<span class="nowrap">13&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
minims, for the opium is
ordered in the same proportion but not previously reduced to
powder or dried. In the Dublin preparation the opium is ordered
to be coarsely powdered, but avoirdupois weight is used
in place of apothecaries, which makes the strength of the
tincture such that 12.75 minims contain <i>one</i> grain.</p>

<p>The error as to the strength of the tincture of opium, which
is found in so many works, has been recently commented on.
Thus Dr. Christison objects to Mr. Phillip’s statements; Dr.
Royle also alludes to it, and so does Mr. Squire, in his recent
work on the Pharmacopœias; and even those writers who have
copied the statement must have done so without much thought
on the subject, as they have calculated the strength of other
preparations of opium, as that of the tinctura opii ammoniata,
tinctura camphoræ composita, assuming that all the active properties
of the opium used in the preparation had
been taken up <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
by the menstrua. And this is the case even with Mr. Phillips
himself, in the case of the compound tincture of camphor, when
he states that <i>nearly two</i> grains of opium are contained in the
ounce, the Pharmacopœia proportions of opium being 1.6
grains only.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>I have brought the question before the Society more for the
purpose of eliciting the opinions of the members on the point,
than with the idea of bringing forward much that is novel on
the subject; if the conclusion to which we have arrived, namely,
that 12 minims of tincture of opium contain all the medical
properties of 1 grain of the crude drug, I think it very important
that the members of the medical profession should be made
fully aware of the delusion under which they have labored for
so many years with regard to the strength of this important
preparation.</p>

<p>Sandi is a resinous gummy substance, produced in abundance
by a tree known by this name, on making an incision in
its bark. At first it presents itself white, or liquid like milk,
and it is called in the province of Barbacoas, “milk of sandi.”
In a few days it acquires the consistency of resinous gum. In
this state it is applied to various medicinal uses in different
parts of New Granada, especially in the province of Barbacoas,
a warm and damp country near the Ecuador, from whence the
present sample comes. Its principal therapeutic property is
<i>resolutive</i>; applied as a plaster upon lupus, fleshy excrescencies
of the skin, cold and indolent tumors, &amp;c. it produces their
resolution; and this result is frequently confirmed
by the <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
inhabitants of those countries. I have obtained it almost always
when I have made use of the milk in similar cases. At present
my father has applied this gum in the valley of Cauca, and
with extraordinary success, for the cure of “bocios,” or obstructions
of the thyroid gland. He has been able to purify it, taking
away the part of potass which it contains in its original state,
and has been able to give it the consistence and color of gum
Arabic; with this substance he makes a plaster, which destroys
the “bocios,” which so much abound in New Granada; and its
general benefits are felt and acknowledged.</p>

<p>It is likewise used as an agent against sterility in women,
applying it as a plaster upon the hypogastric region. In ulcers
of a good character I have obtained frequent and quick cicatrisation
by applying it in the same manner; I have also used it
as a vehicle for preparing and applying blisters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A<b>CEITE</b></span>
 <span class="smmaj">DE</span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>ALO</b></span>
 (oil of wood) is produced by a tree called
“manteco,” in the same province. Its principal therapeutic
qualities are topical and blistering. By using it as an embrocation
I have destroyed the epidermis, and have thus been able
to get rid of freckles and superficial stains on the face and
other parts of the body. Applied in larger quantities it produces
the effect of a strong blister, excoriating and inflaming the
skin. This oil is used in its natural state as an ointment, on
arms and instruments of steel: it destroys their temper and
softens them. By decoction it loses these qualities, and might
be used as an ointment without any risk. It cannot be used as
a lamp-oil, because it exhales a very thick smoke and the most
disagreeable smell. It has no known internal medicinal qualities;
it may be classed amongst the corrosive poisons; its color
is purple, its taste <i>sui generis</i>.</p>

but has no known medicinal qualities. It
is used also <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>

blows or falls, and I have always obtained a good result. The
pitch is a resinous substance, of a dark yellow color, and constitutes
the hive made by this bee. It has a peculiar taste and

<p><span class="smcap">C<b>ANEDILLO.</b></span>—This is the name of a cane with a bitter and
aromatic bark, and, in my opinion, it belongs to the family of
Winter’s bark. It has many therapeutic qualities; amongst
others it has particularly attracted my attention as an antidote
against the bite of snakes and of other venomous animals. I
consider it the best and safest of all the antidotes known. Put
two ounces of this bark in a bottle of alcohol, allow it to macerate
for three or four hours, to obtain a tincture. Use two
parts of this mixture with common water; a wineglass every
two hours until you allay the headache of the bitten person—an
infallible consequence of the bite, cupping at the same time,
and extracting the tooth, which often remains in the part, which
is then to be washed and covered with lint wetted with the tincture.
By this simple method I have cured hundreds, without
the loss of a single life. This antidote is now generally kept
by all the owners of mines, as a certain cure for bites of snakes,
in preference to other antidotes formerly used. It has this advantage
over them, that it may be taken in any quantity without
danger. It is, besides, a tonic and anti-spasmodic. I have
used it also as a febrifuge; in rheumatism (by friction); and in
the windy colic, taken in the same way as for
bites by snakes. <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>

<h3>ON THE SODA-PYROPHOSPHATE OF IRON.
<span class="hsmall">
BY ALEXANDER URE, ESQ., SURGEON TO ST. MARY’S HOSPITAL.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>My attention was attracted some time back by an ingenious
paper of Mons. Persoz on the double pyrophosphoric salts, published
in the <i>Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie</i> for 1848.
In the latter part of that paper, the author expresses an opinion
that the pyrophosphoric salts are likely to prove of importance
as medicinal agents. It is well known that iron is rendered
very eligible for internal use, if administered in the form of a
triple salt, as when combined, for example, with tartaric acid
and potash; because the iron then is no longer precipitable by
the alkaline hydrate. It would appear, however that the soda
pyrophosphate of iron is in many respects superior as a medicine
to the triple salts into which the vegetable acids enter.—Thus,
the pyrophosphoric salt, from being saturated with oxygen,
cannot in passing through the system absorb more, whereas
the latter salts under like circumstances, are constantly undergoing
a process of combustion, according to Millon; and by
withdrawing oxygen in this manner, must necessarily impair
the efficacy of the oxide of iron as an oxydizing agent. It deserves
notice, moreover, that the constituent ingredients of the
soda-pyrophosphate of iron are to be found
in the organism. <span class="xxpn" id="p093">{93}</span></p>

<p>I have prescribed this salt to various patients, and found it
to act as a mild but efficient chalybeate. One little scrofulous
girl, now under my care in St. Mary’s Hospital, for disease of
the hip-joint, has taken it in solution during several months
with the best effect. The remedy was accurately prepared by
Mr. Blyth, dispenser to the hospital, according to the subjoined
directions of Mons. Persoz: 32.5 grammes of green sulphate of
iron in crystals are to be mixed in a porcelain capsule with 5
grammes of sulphuric acid, 30 grammes of water, and as much
nitro-muriatic acid as will suffice to effect the oxidation of the
protoxide of iron. The above mixture is to be evaporated to
dryness in order to get rid of the free acid, and then treated
with water to the amount of one litre. From 107 to 110
grammes of crystallized pyrophosphate of soda are to be dissolved
likewise in a litre of water, of course in a separate vessel.
The two solutions are next to be mixed together, and provided
the iron solution has been rightly prepared there will be no
precipitate whatever.</p>

<p>Each litre of liquid will contain as much iron as 16.5 of the
green sulphate.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>This solution is not affected by dilution with rain or distilled
water, but from being faintly alkaline, is rendered slightly turbid
on the addition of water impregnated with lime.</p>

<h3>ON THE SIMABA CEDRON.
<span class="hsmall">
BY M. BERTHOLD SEEMANN.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>A tree, which has attained great celebrity, is that called <i>Cedron</i>
(<i>Simaba Cedron</i>, Planch.). The most ancient record of
it which I can find is in the <i>History of the Buccaneers</i>, an old
work published in London in the year 1699. Its use as an antidote
for the bite of snakes, and its place of growth, are there
distinctly stated; but whether on the authority of the natives,
or accidentally discovered by the pirates, does
not appear. If <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
the former was the case, they must have learned it while on some
of their cruises on the Magdalena, for in the Isthmus the very
existence of the tree was unsuspected until about 1845, when Don
Juan de Ansoatigui, ascertained, by comparison, that the <i>Cedron</i>
of Panama and Darien was identical with that of Carthagena.
The virtues of its seeds, however, were known, years ago, from
those fruits imported from the Magdalena, where, according to
Mr. William Purdie, the plant grows in profusion about the
village of San Pablo. In the Isthmus it is generally found on
the outskirts of forests in almost every part of the country, but
in greater abundance in Darien and Veraguas than in Panama.
The natives hold it in high esteem, and always carry a piece of
the seed about with them. When a person is bitten, a little,
mixed with water, is applied to the wound, and about two
grains scraped into brandy, or, in the absence of it, into water,
is administered internally. By following this treatment the
bites of the most venomous snakes, scorpions, centipedes, and
other noxious animals, have been unattended with dangerous
consequences. Doses of it have also proved highly beneficial
in cases of intermittent fever. The <i>Cedron</i> is a tree, from
twelve to sixteen feet high; its simple trunk is about six inches
in diameter, and clothed on the top with long pinnated leaves,
which give it the appearance of a palm. Its flowers are greenish,
and the fruit resembles very much an unripe peach. Each
seed, or cotyledon I should rather say, is sold in the chemist’s
shops in Panama for two or three reals (about 1<i>s.</i> or 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
English), and sometimes a much larger price is given for them.—<i>Hooker’s
Journal of Botany.</i></p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">

<p class="padtopb fsz6">[A large number of the Cedron seeds have lately been received in New
York, probably from a section of the country where they are cheaper
than upon the Isthmus. As a remedy for the bites of venomous reptiles,
like all others of the same class, it is of little value, but from its
intense bitterness, it may be expected to possess great tonic powers,
and if, in addition to these, further experience shall confirm the
report of its virtues as an antiperiodic, it will prove a remedy of
great value.]—<span class="smcap">E<b>D.</b></span>

<span class="smcap">C<b>OLCHICUM</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>UTUMNALE.</b></span></h4>—In
the December number of the Edinburgh Monthly
Journal of Medical Science, Dr. J. McGrigor Maclagan, has published an article
on Colchicum Autumnale, which contains little that is new, but is of interest
as confirming the statements of other observers. The ordinary mode of
propagation of the plant by the formation of a single new bulb is thus described.
In June, “the bulb is as large as an apricot, firm, amylaceous, and extremely
bitter, and having attached to it the shrivelled remains of the old bulb, and the
leaves now yellow and decayed. At the end of June or commencement of July,
a small bulb will be observed to have become developed upon the side of the
corm at its lower part. At this time it is a little larger than a grain of wheat,
and lies in a little fissure on the side of the parent bulb, a little above the origin
of the radicles. It increases slowly and gradually in size till the beginning of
August, when it appears as a dilatation of the flower stalk, which it then commences
to put up.</div>

<p>In September the flower is in full perfection, the long tube of the perianth of
which has raised the six partite limb to the height of from six to eight inches above
the ground. The flower remains for two or three weeks, and then dies down;
and nothing of the plant is seen above the surface till the beginning of February,
when the leaf stalk commences to rise. If at this time the plant be taken up, the
old and new bulb will still be found to be united, but the new one will be observed
to have increased little in size since autumn, being still hardly larger
in diameter than the leaf stalk. The bulb thus grows little during the autumn,
but in winter it increases rapidly in size; in April it is like a large hazel nut, and
from that time it increases still more till the end of June or the beginning of July,
when it is, as Dr. Christison states, as large as an apricot.</p>

<p>In April the leaf stalk is found perfected by a fine group of dark green leaves,
generally three in number, and having within their sheath the capsules which
ought to ripen their fruit in the course of the summer.</p>

<p>In May the old bulb will be found dry and withered, and containing very little
starch; and in July if the plant be taken up, three bulbs will be found, the first
now reduced to the form of a membrane, bearing no resemblance to a bulb at all;
the second, arrived at full growth; and a third the progeny of the second.</p>

<p>In February and August, instead of one leaf stalk and flower stalk making their
appearance at their respective periods, I have often remarked that two have
occurred, one on either side of the parent bulb. I believe this to be one of the
effects of cultivation, as I have no where seen it remarked in descriptions of the
plant by botanical authors.</p>

<p>Dr. Christison has mentioned that the full size of a Colchicum bulb is that of a
small apricot. Where the plant has been cultivated however, Dr. Maclagan,
frequently met with them as big as large apples, and on one occasion procured
one in October weighing nine and
a half ounces. <span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span></p>

<p>He thinks that the cormus should be taken for medicinal use about the middle
of July, at which time it has attained its greatest size, and is firm, amylaceous
and exceedingly bitter. The bitterness is the best criterion of its medicinal
activity.</p>

<p>A number of years ago, Dr. A. T. Thomson, proposed the tincture of Guaiacum
as a test for the goodness of Colchicum. Ten grains of the bulb were rubbed in
a mortar, with sixteen minims of distilled vinegar, and immediately afterwards
sixteen minims of the tincture of guaiacum were added. When the bulb was
good, a beautiful cerulean color, according to Dr. Thomson, was produced.
Having ascertained that several specimens which he knew to be good failed in
giving this char­ac­ter­is­tic color, Dr. M. proceeded to investigate the causes on
which it depended. He expressed several bulbs and filtered the juice to separate
the starch; a beautiful blue color was now immediately produced by the test.
The blue liquid was then heated till the albumen was coagulated; the color remained
with the coagulum, while the liquid was colorless. On raising the heat
to 212° the blue color disappeared. The test produced no change in the starch
collected on the filter. When the fluid was boiled previously to the application
of the test, no blue color was produced by it either with the filtered fluid or
the coagulum. From these experiments Dr. M. concludes, “1st. That albumen
is the principle acted on. 2nd. That a heat above 180° destroys this action.
3rd. That the value of the test is to prove that the bulbs have been dried at a
temperature not higher than 180°.”</p>

<p>Dr. Maclagan was unable to procure colchicia, the alkaloid announced by
Geiger &amp; Hesse, in the crystalline form, though he followed the process they give
very exactly, and consequently he doubts its crystalline nature. What he obtained
was in the form of a brown resinous looking mass without smell, and of a
bitter taste, the bitterness being followed by a slight sense of irritation in the
throat but by nothing like the intense acrimony of veratria.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>In regard to the physiological action of Colchicum, Dr. M. confirms the statement
of previous observers, that it markedly increases the amount of urea in the
urine; and contrary to what has been maintained by some, found it likewise to
increase the quantity of uric add. In an experiment related in detail, after the
colchicum had been employed for six days, the amount of urea in the urine was
found to be increased by nearly one half, and the uric acid was more than doubled.</p>

<p>In giving formulæ it is to be supposed that the purpose of a
Pharmacopœia is to be practical, responding to the every day
wants of the associated professions of medicine and pharmacy.
It would seem to be in no case of practical utility to retain a
formula that is not used, and of this character I think is the
one for “<span class="smcap">M<b>UCILAGE</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">G<b>UM</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>RABIC</b>.”</span> It does not appear to
be employed of the consistence directed except as a paste.
Nor is this consistence understood when mucilage of gum
arabic is prescribed by physicians, but by some apothecaries a
solution of only one eighth, and by others, one fourth the
strength is put up. If physicians are expected to prescribe,
and apothecaries to compound according to the letter of the
Pharmacopœia, this is certainly a daily and unfortunately,
owing to the want of a standard, a variable exception.
The formula in our Pharmacopœia is substantially the same
as in those of London and Edinburgh, while that of Dublin is
one half stronger. In the latter three it enters into other
officinal preparations, but in every case it is combined with
water, which appears to be a needless multiplication of the process,
as the proper proportions of gum and water for the whole
might as well be directed at once. Nor, is it
probably used in <span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span>
extemporaneous prescription without similar addition of water,
unless it may be to form pills, for which it is rarely, if ever, well
adapted, or employed by the apothecary when it is prescribed,
as it makes, with most substances, an intractable mass. I have
been told by a highly intelligent and well educated English
apothecary, that “it was formerly the practice of English physicians
to prescribe one ounce of mucilage of gum arabic with
seven ounces of water, (or in that proportion,) making a solution
of the strength now commonly used here, and that it had
become gradually the practice to direct the whole quantity required,
under the term of ‘mucilage of gum arabic,’ with the
general understanding that the diluted strength was intended.”
As this seems to be now the universal practice in prescribing
and putting up mixtures, the officinal directions are practically
useless, and lead to the adoption of various proportions by
different apothecaries, to produce the mucilage to complete
mixtures.</p>

<p>Another circumstance may be noticed. The Pharmacopœia
directs the use of powdered gum and of boiling water, whereas
gum, in its ordinary condition or coarsely broken, and cold
water make a clearer solution. Cold water is directed for the
solution of the gum by the Edinburgh process, and in our present
formula for “Syrup of Gum Arabic;”—if appropriate for the
latter, it is quite as much so for the forming of mucilage. When
the gum has been ground in a mill it appears to have been
a little charred and forms a somewhat turbid solution; if
powdered by hand, and rather more coarsely, its solution is
clearer.</p>

<p>Upon the whole it seems desirable that there should be a
uniform strength for the mucilage of gum arabic, prescribed by
physicians in mixtures, which the officinal preparation evidently
is not. Our mucilage does not enter into any other officinal
preparations, and if it did, the combination of gum and water
had better be made in the general process, as in our almond
mixture.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">C<b>OMPOUND</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>PIRIT</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">L<b>AVENDER</b>”</span> appears to
be but seldom <span class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span>
made according to the officinal directions, owing to the difficulty
of procuring the simple spirit of lavender. On this
account most apothecaries use a proportion of the oil of lavender
and of spirit, variable no doubt in different private recipes.
The oil makes a decidedly inferior preparation, separating
upon admixture with water, and even the best English oil—which
is probably never used—is less congenial to the stomach
than the distilled spirit. But the difficulty may be overcome,
and an excellent preparation, essentially the same and perhaps
quite equal in quality and flavor to that of the Pharmacopœia,
may be made by the employment of recently dried flowers.
The following is the formula I have used for several years, with
an entirely satisfactory result:―</p>

<div class="dpoembox"><ul class="ulin2">
<li class="livs">Take of Lavender flowers twelve ounces,</li>
<li class="livs">&#160;&#160;Rosemary leaves,</li>

<span class="smcap">“S<b>YRUP</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">G<b>UM</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>RABIC,”</b></span> unaccountably withdrawn from
the Pharmacopœia in 1840, when it had become a familiar
favorite, comes to us again in the new revision, not at all improved
by seclusion. It is changed in its proportions, but not
for the better, as it now has too little gum and too much sugar
in its composition. Of numerous formulæ by which I have
made this syrup, I have always found that from our Pharmacopœia
of 1830, the best in proportions, consistence and
flavor. It is defective however, in one point of construction,
and incorrect in the use of boiling water to make the solution
of gum. The syrup is probably not better in any essential
particular, but it is clearer, and therefore
more pleasing in <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
appearance, when it is constructed by making the solutions of
gum and sugar separately, that of the gum in half the water
cold, and that of the sugar in the remainder of the water
boiling, then immediately combining the two and bringing to
the boiling point. It may then be easily filtered through
flannel.</p>

<p>In preparing “<span class="smcap">S<b>YRUP</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>ITRIC</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>CID</b>,”</span> it would be preferable
to use, in place of the oil of lemon, a tincture made from
the outside yellow part of the rind of the fresh fruit, made by
covering it with pure alcohol. Two drachms of this tincture
are about equivalent to four minims of the oil of lemon.</p>

<p>The formula for “<span class="smcap">S<b>YRUP</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>PECACUANHA</b>”</span> is one of the most
objectionable we have to notice, and the least calculated to
answer medical wants in regard to its importance. There is
a verbal error, either in the list of components or in the directions,
which leads to some confusion. Amongst the former we
find “<i>diluted alcohol</i>,” and in the latter, we are told to “macerate
the ipecacuanha in the <i>alcohol, &amp;c.</i>” The same error occurs
in the edition of 1840. This formula is unnecessarily complex,
and yields an inefficient preparation of about half the strength of
the wine of ipecac, which it was intended to equal at its origin,
about twelve years before its introduction into our Pharmacopœia.
Previously to this it had, for six or eight years, been
made here of about double the strength of the wine, in accordance
with the general plan of forming medicinal syrups, by
combining as large a proportion of the remedial agent in them
as can readily be done, to obviate at once the necessity of bulky
doses, and the exhibition of undue quantities of sugar. I cannot
discover the advantage of making a pint of tincture with
an ounce of the root, evaporating the filtered tincture to six
fluid ounces, filtering again, and then adding water to bring
back the measure of a pint. If the object be to get rid of the
alcohol, it is an unnecessary exposure of the soluble principles
of the ipecac to heat, for half a pint of diluted alcohol, especially
with four ounces of water added by way of displacement, would
exhaust the root equally well; so that the
evaporation need not <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span>
be carried so far. There is no mention of a water bath, which
should be used by all means.</p>

<p>We should prefer, if we could, to make all preparations
which the Pharmacopœia contains, in accordance with it. But
when a preparation has been in such general and favorite use,
for several years, as to be considered indispensable before it
becomes officinal; and in such form is reduced to a third or a
fourth of what is felt to be an eligible strength, not only without
any compensating advantage, but with the positive disadvantages
of greatly diluting its remedial influence, and increasing
the quantity required to be taken of a nauseous medicine, there
is naturally an unwillingness to yield well settled convictions
of utility, and replace an important remedy, that has proved
quite satisfactory, with a preparation believed to be of comparatively
little value. It is not probable that, in New York,
the present officinal syrup of ipecacuanha, can ever supersede
the efficient and reliable one we have so long been accustomed
to, nor answer the wishes and expectations of the medical profession.
I append the formula proposed in a paper read before
the Board of Trustees in 1835, seven years before one
for this syrup appeared in our Pharmacopœia. I have not
found cause to change it in any respect. It affords about three
pints of syrup, which keeps well for years at the ordinary temperatures
of the shop, and of dwellings; the proportion of sugar
proves to be just what is wanted for a proper consistence without
cry­stal­li­za­tion, and, as a medicine, it gives entire satisfaction
to the prescriber. It is as follows:―</p>

<div class="dpoembox"><ul class="ulin2">
<li class="livs">Take of Ipecacuanha, bruised, six ounces,</li>
<li class="livs">&#160;&#160;Alcohol one pint and a half,</li>
<li class="livs">&#160;&#160;Water one pint,</li></ul>
</div>

<p><i>Mix, to form a tincture. Digest for ten days, filter, and
add one pint of water, by way of displacement, evaporate in
a water bath to two pints, add immediately:</i></p>

<div class="ulin2 pleft">Refined sugar three pounds and a quarter.</div>

<p><i>And bring to the boiling point.</i></p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">C<b>OMPOUND</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>YRUP</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>QUILL</b>”</span> is
presented in the <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
Pharmacopœia with two processes for its preparation. The
first is liable, though in a less degree, to the same objection
which has rendered the original form, given by Dr. Coxe,
obsolete, that it produces a turbid syrup, and one that will not
keep. The second process is better, but scarcely adequate, I
should think, to extract the full strength of the roots so well as
by the employment of a greater proportion of alcohol, and
longer digestion. The following produces three and a half pints
of syrup from the same materials, apparently stronger than if
the boiling, which is only for a few minutes, were continued
down to three pints, retaining a portion of honey, for the sake
of the flavor, and with as large an addition of sugar as the
syrup will bear without cry­stal­li­za­tion. The proportion of tartar
emetic is, of course, the same:</p>

<div class="dpoembox"><ul class="ulin2">
<li class="livs">Take of Seneka, bruised,</li>
<li class="livs">&#160;&#160;Squills, bruised, each four ounces.</li>

<li class="livs">&#160;&#160;Water each two pints.</li>
</ul></div>

<p><i>Mix, to form a tincture. Digest ten days, filter, and add
twelve ounces of water, by way of displacement, evaporate by
water bath to two pints, add:</i></p>

<div class="dpoembox"><ul class="ulin2">
<li class="livs">Sugar fifteen ounces,</li>
<li class="livs">Honey eighteen ounces,</li>
</ul></div>

<p><i>Boil to three pints and a half, in which dissolve while hot:</i></p>

<div class="ulin2 pleft">Tartar emetic fifty-six grains.</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">S<b>YRUP</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">T<b>OLU</b>,”</span> made after the London formula, is a more
elegant and better flavored preparation than can be made by
any combination of the tincture. So decided is the superiority
of the London process, that it is rather surprising the other
Pharmacopœias should not adopt it. An apothecary who
does, will hardly be satisfied with the tincture-made syrup
afterwards.</p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">T<b>INCTURE</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>CONITE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">R<b>OOT</b>”</span> is desired by our physicians
of full saturation. The “strong tincture,” to which we have
been accustomed for several years, is that of Fleming’s process,
viz: sixteen ounces of the root to a pint and a
half of alcohol. <span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span></p>

<p>The “<span class="smcap">C<b>OMPOUND</b></span>
<span class="smcap">T<b>INCTURE</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>ARDAMOM</b>”</span> is now first introduced
into our Pharmacopœia, with a change from the pleasant
tincture we have been in the habit of making after the London
or Edinburgh formula, by increasing the proportion of cardamom,
from two drachms and a half to six drachms, and reducing
the caraway one fifth, which makes a tincture not near so
pleasant to the taste, owing to the strong predominance of the
cardamom flavor, which is rather harsh when in too great excess.
As this tincture is of little medical importance by itself,
and chiefly used as an agreeable adjunct to mixtures, the proportions
which have been found to answer so well may still be
considered preferable.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>There are other cases, no doubt, in which apothecaries will
find it expedient to vary the processes of carrying out formulæ,
not with a view of altering the strength of preparations, but
arriving at substantially the same results or better ones, from
the same materials, by improved application of skill. Whoever
can, by superior method, more fully develope the qualities
of a substance to be acted upon, than has hitherto been done,
or change the character of a preparation from perishable to
permanent, from uncertain to definite, from slovenly to elegant,
can accomplish something for the benefit of his art, and render
it so much the more useful to the community. Most of the
improvements in pharmacy have been effected by the practical
apothecary, and rendered available by him, in advance of the
Pharmacopœia.</p>

<h3>NOTES IN PHARMACY.
<span class="hsmall">
BY BENJAMIN CANAVAN.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The fact in the natural kingdom, that “nothing is destroyed,”
suggests an equally true axiom, as applied to the moral
world, that “nothing is useless;” and, with this impression, I
am induced to send the following trifles to the New York Journal
of Pharmacy, which, if not unacceptable, it will give me
pleasure to repeat
“<i>pro re natâ</i>.” <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P<b>IL.</b></span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>ERRI</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>OMP.</b></span>—This very much neglected pill, which is
the prototype and should have precluded the necessity of Vallet’s
preparation, I would beg leave to introduce, for the purpose
of recommending, or rather verifying an improvement
which I have sometimes adopted, in the mode of compounding
it, differing from the officinal directions for so doing. We are
told to “rub the myrrh with the carb. sodæ; then add the
sulph. ferri, and again rub them; lastly, beat them with the
syrup so as to form a mass.” I do not hesitate to say that no
amount of trituration or skill, with which I am acquainted, will
enable the manipulator by this means to make the mass properly,
either in a chemical or phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal point of view.—In
a note the editor of the United States Dispensatory informs
us: “It is said the salt of iron will be better preserved, if the
operator should dissolve the sulphate of iron in the syrup with
a moderate heat and then add the carb. sodæ, <i>stirring!</i> till effervescence
ceases;” this is correct in principle; but the same
object is attained, and the <i>only</i> way by which the pill ought
or can be properly prepared, is by triturating separately, and
to solution the two salts in the necessary quantity of syrup,
mixing, and again triturating until perfect decomposition is induced,
and by incorporating the myrrh, form into a mass without
delay. In this way you insure the existence of the
intended proto carb. ferri in the pill, which is not, or only
partially the case when prepared by any other process. I
would remark, en passant, that this pill presents us with the
very perishable proto carb. in the <i>most permanent</i> form, retaining,
when properly prepared, its chemical integrity unimpaired,
indefinitely, and is therefore superior in this important respect to
the quickly changeable mist. ferri comp., the presence also of a
larger proportion of myrrh being often a decided advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E<b>XTRACTA</b></span>
<span class="smcap">L<b>IQUIDA</b></span>
<span class="smcap">O<b>PII.</b></span>—It has been suggested, and I believe
attempted, to introduce certain preparations with the
above titles, as substitutes for the demi-nostrum, known as
“McMunn’s Elixir of Opium,” which has been very extensively
used, and enjoyed high favor, but of which
the exact nature <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
and mode of preparation are not generally understood, and which,
either from having become too antiquated for this novelty hunting
age, or its success having tempted the cupidity of avaricious
persons, or from whatever cause, has been for some time
diminishing in popularity, and subjected to many complaints.
In all preparations of this potent drug, with which I am acquainted,
ancient or modern, the great object has been, to get
rid of the narcotine, which has been more or less accomplished
by various processes. At present an aqueous fluid extract is
said to supply the desideratum. This is merely a modification
of the watery extract of all the Pharmacopœias, and is no doubt
as good, but no better preparation. The denarcotised tincture
is superior to all of them, and the <i>very small</i> quantity of spirit
contained in an ordinary dose, is scarcely an objection, and is
only little more than is necessary to preserve the extract; but
if deemed otherwise, a fluid extract may be prepared from denarcotised
opium, <i>entirely free</i> from the peccant alkaloid, and
possibly the evaporation necessary to the process, may dissipate
some noxious volatile property, which would exist in a tincture,
and which it is most probable the opium possesses, from the
fact, among others, that <i>old opium</i> is much less prone than <i>new</i>
to cause disagreeable after effects. It has been supposed that
meconic acid has been the evicted principle; but this is doubtful.
However, the action of heat is useful, and I think a
“fluid extract of denarcotised opium,” would perhaps be found
to be as free as possible from objectionable effects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E<b>THER</b></span>
<span class="smcap">H<b>YDROCHLORIC;</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>HLORINAT</b>:</span> or ether hydrochlorique
chlorè, as the French have it, is another change, rung by M.
Mialhe of Paris, with the transcendental compounds of carbon
and chlorine. It is a mongrel preparation, intermediate between
hydrochloric: ether and chloroform, professing to have
the advantage of not irritating the skin like the latter. If
this be so, experience will tell, and also whether the irritation
is not proportionable to the effect. With regard to
such a refinement of an already infinitesimally delicate
class of preparations, I should suppose it
would be <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>
desirable to effect the object aimed at by them, by if possible
some more palpable method, as for instance diluting chloroform
either with hydrochloric ether or alcohol, to the necessary
mildness, or by interposing between it and the skin, a thin
<i>moist</i> layer of some substance, as bibulous paper, which would
not interfere with the rigefacient effect of evaporation, and
would prevent any injury arising from actual contact.</p>

<h3>INDELIBLE INK.
<span class="hsmall">
BY M. GUILLER, OF PARIS.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Hitherto the various inks prepared for marking linen, have
but imperfectly answered the end proposed. Some produced
yellowish marks; others though blacker at first, disappeared
either partially or entirely after several washings.</p>

<p>Again, others, in separate bottles, necessitated two distinct
operations, and were thus attended with inconvenience, from
the possibility of mistakes or forgetfulness, from the care required,
and also from the time taken up in the operation.</p>

<p>In view of these difficulties, and to meet a demand constantly
occurring in commerce, and in all kinds of manufactures, as
well as in hospitals, and civil and military ad­min­i­stra­tions,
we have applied ourselves to the composition of an ink free
from all these objections, and perfectly easy and certain in its
application.</p>

<p>We shall subjoin some formulæ for the manufacture of
marking inks, which represent particular improvements, as can
be verified by trying them.</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">

<p>Dissolve the 22 parts of sub-carbonate of soda in the 85
parts of water; put into a marble mortar the gum,
and pour on <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
it very gradually the solution of the sub-carbonate, stirring it
with the pestle to cause it to dissolve.</p>

<p>In the mean time, you will have dissolved the 11 parts of
nitrate in the 20 parts of liquid ammonia. Mix the two solutions;
put the whole in a matrass and expose it to heat. The
mass which was of a dirty grey color, and half coagulated, becomes
clear and brown, and when arrived at the boiling point,
it becomes very dark, and sufficiently limpid to flow readily
in the pen. This ink, made without heat like the two following
forms no sediment, the ebullition thickening it, and besides
giving the ink a very dark color, disengages the ammoniacal
vapors, which attenuate the odor of the ammonia in it.</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="">

</table></div></div>

<p>Mix as in No. 1; put the whole into a matrass and evaporate
until the liquor has acquired a very dark brown tint, which
will take place when it has lost about 5 per cent. of its bulk;
a more complete evaporation would form a precipitate, as the
vapors would draw off too much of the ammonia.</p>

<p>This ink will be found excellent for marking, the character
will be very black, and it will be found especially useful for
applying with the stamp.</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">

 <td class="pleft">Sulphate of copper,</td>
 <td class="pleft">33 grammes.</td></tr>
</table></div></div><!--dtablebox-->

<p>First dissolve the 22 parts of sub-carbonate in the 25 parts
of water, and the 15 of nitrate in the 42 of ammonia.</p>

<p>This done, put into the marble mortar the 20 parts of
gum with the sixty parts of water which
remain, stir it <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
with the pestle, and pour on it the solution of sub-carbonate,
after which, pour the whole into the solution of the nitrate;
finish by adding the 33 parts of the solution of sulphate of
copper.</p>

<p>The greater quantity of ammonia is explained by the presence
of the sulphate to be dissolved.</p>

<p>This composition differs from the others in having a blue
tinge, due to the solution of copper.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that these relative qualities, given as
formulæ for the production of suitable inks, may vary according
as it is desirable to produce a thicker or thiner ink, or
according to the material on which it is to be used, observing
that if, on the one hand, the ammonia acts as a solvent,
and facilitates the composition of an ink which can be used
without a previous preparation; on the other hand, the
evaporation of a part of the ammonia by heat, gives to the
liquid a dark color which renders the writing immediately
black; again, the boiled liquid greases less, and thus penetrates
and spreads better on the linen without making a blot.</p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>As to the mode of using, whether with a pen or a stamp
proceed as usual, namely: pass a hot iron over the writing, to
cause it more completely to penetrate the material.</p>

<p>Although some of the combinations of valerianic acid with
bases, and the properties of those salts, have been described in
the books on chemistry, yet I believe I may lay claim to the
priority of the preparation of an extensive series of the combination
of valerianic
acid with bases. <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span></p>

<p>Valerianic acid, it is well known, occurs preformed in certain
plants; and it is equally well known, that it can be produced
in the laboratory by artificial means. This very fact is
of great interest to the investigating chemist, as it encourages
him in the belief that he will, sooner or later, be able to produce
artificially, not only acids, which are known to exist in
the animal and vegetable kingdoms; but that he will so far
imitate Nature in her wonderful processes, as to produce the
vegetable alkaloids, morphia, quina, &amp;c., by the combination
of their elements.</p>

<p>The acid employed in the preparation of this series, <i>for which
I have had the honor of being awarded a Prize Medal by the
Jurors of the Great Exhibition</i>, was prepared, in principle,
the same as that directed to be used by the Dublin Pharmacopœia
in the preparation of valerianate of soda, namely, the
oxidation of Fusel oil by means of chromic acid. The formula
I employed is as follows:―</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="">
<caption class="pleft">Take of</caption>
<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Bichromate of potash,</td>
 <td class="pleft">2&#160;parts.</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Oil of vitriol,</td>

 <td class="pleft">4 parts.</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Pure Fusel oil,</td>
 <td class="pleft">1 parts.</td></tr>
</table></div></div><!--dtablebox-->

<p>The bichromate of potash is to be finely powdered and dissolved
in the water; the solution being put into a glass retort,
the oil of vitriol is gradually added, and, when quite cold, the
<i>fusel oil</i> is carefully added; the contents of the vessel must
be constantly agitated, and at the same time kept immersed
in cold water. The deep green liquid is now distilled from a
sand bath; the distillate is mixed with caustic soda, or potash,
and separated from the oily fluid floating on the surface; the
<i>valerianate of soda</i> is evaporated to a convenient degree of
concentration, introduced into a retort, decomposed with dilute
sulphuric acid, and distilled; the liberated valerianic acid is
finally dried over chloride of calcium.</p>

<p>It is also obtained by the oxidation of oil of valerian, by
means of an alkali. It is formed from fats,
by treating them <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
with fuming nitric acid; from animal nitrogenous matters, both
by putrefaction and on decomposing them with strong nitric
acid; and also if leucine be treated with caustic potash, or
allowed to putrefy, it becomes converted into valerianic acid
(no other acid being formed), ammonia and hydrogen being
evolved.</p>

<p>It is most easily obtained in a state of absolute purity by the
action of spongy platinum and atmospheric air upon potatoe
Fusel oil.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Valerianic acid is composed of C<sub>10</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>9</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>3</sub>,&#x202f;H&#x202f;O. It possesses
a well known char­ac­ter­is­tic odour, an acrid burning taste, and
produces a white spot on the tongue. It boils at 348° Fahr.,
and dissolves in 26 parts water; it also forms a second
hydrate.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanch8">8</a></p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h4><i>Combinations with the Alkalies.</i></h4>

<p>The potash salt was prepared by saturating the acid with
liquor potassæ, and evaporating carefully until aqueous vapour
ceased to be given off: it should be, while still warm, cut up and
preserved in well stoppered bottles. It does not crystallize, but
forms a semi-transparent colorless mass, very much resembling
phosphorus in appearance. It (probably from its compactness)
produces when sharply struck with any hard body a metallic
sound, somewhat like that occasioned when a bell of camphor is
struck in a similar manner. It is deliquescent,
and very soluble.</p></div>

<p>The soda salt was prepared in the same manner as the potash
salt, cut up into pieces while warm, and preserved in stoppered
bottles: it is in snow-white masses composed of minute crystals;
it is deliquescent, and very soluble. The ammonia salt was
prepared by saturating the acid with strong liquor ammoniæ,
and evaporating at a temperature not exceeding 100° Fahr.,
until crystals appeared on the surface of the liquid. When it
was set aside for further cry­stal­li­za­tion, the mother liquor was
allowed to drain off, the crystals were placed upon bibulous
paper, and finally dried <i>in vacuo</i>, over oil
of vitriol. They are <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
of a tabular form; when held between the fingers for a moment,
they become liquid. They are deliquescent and dissolve readily
in water.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h4><i>Combinations with the Alkaline Earths.</i></h4>

<p>The baryta salt was prepared by adding the acid to carbonate
of baryta in excess, which had been previously mixed with
water; a gentle heat was applied, and, when the disengagement
of carbonic acid had ceased, the excess of carbonate was
filtered off; the filtrate was evaporated very carefully, until
aqueous vapour ceased to be given off, it remained a transparent
gummy mass, readily soluble in water.</p></div>

<p>The strontia, lime, and magnesia salts were prepared in the
same manner as the baryta salt. The two former are crystalline,
and do not deliquesce by exposure to the atmosphere; they
are soluble. The lime salt crystallizes in nacreous plates; it
effloresces when exposed to the atmosphere; it is beautifully
white.</p>

<p>The magnesia salt would not crystallize, therefore it was
evaporated to dryness, at a temperature not exceeding 120°
Fahr. It forms a light white soluble powder, sweet to the taste,
and strong in the char­ac­ter­is­tic odour of valerianic acid.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h4><i>Combinations with Metallic Oxides.</i></h4>

<p>The alumina, chromium, and nickel salts were prepared by the
direct combination of the hydrates of those bases with the acid.</p>
</div>

<p>The alumina and chromium salts are in powder, and are
soluble.</p>

<p>The nickel salt is in crystalline masses, of an apple-green
color, soluble in water.</p>

<p>The cobalt salt was also prepared by the direct way; the
flocculent blue precipitate, obtained by precipitation from
nitrate of cobalt, by means of caustic potash, after being well
washed, was dissolved in valerianic acid, filtered and very carefully
evaporated to dryness; it occurs in masses of a rose color,
and is soluble.</p>

<p>The manganese salt was also prepared in the
direct way by <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
mixing an excess of the hydrated oxide with water and the
acid, allowing them to remain in contact for some time, filtering
and evaporating at a temperature not exceeding 120° Fahr.,
until crystals appeared on the surface of the fluids; it was set
aside, and after a while, the crystals were separated from the
mother liquor. The latter being again evaporated, another crop
of crystals was obtained; it occurs in glistening scales of a flesh
color, and dissolves very readily in water.</p>

<p>The valerianate of <i>protoxide of iron</i> was prepared by the
double decomposition of valerianate of baryta and proto-sulphate
of iron; it can only be kept in a state of solution, as least the
heat and exposure to the air converts it immediately into the
peroxide salt.</p>

<p>The valerianate of <i>peroxide of iron</i>, was prepared by bringing
together neutral cold solutions of perchloride of iron and
valerianate of soda, the precipitated valerianate was thrown
upon a filter, well washed, to separate the chloride of sodium,
and dried without heat on a porous tile; it occurs as a bright
red loose powder, perfectly soluble in alcohol.</p>

<p>The valerianate of zinc was prepared according to the directions
in the Dublin Pharmacopœia; it occurs in small smooth
crystals, somewhat like boracic acid; it is soluble in water and
alcohol.</p>

<p>The lead salt was prepared by decomposing freshly precipitated
carbonate of lead with the acid, filtering and evaporating
at a low temperature. In due time, crystals made their appearance
in the fluid; but (probably from the temperature being too
high) they subsequently disappeared; and, upon further evaporation,
it remained in the form of a syrup.</p>

<p>The silver salt was produced by the double decomposition of
nitrate of silver, and valerianate of soda. The valerianate of
silver being very insoluble, was precipitated as a white powder;
after washing with cold water, it was dried in the dark on a
porous tile. By exposure to the light, it becomes black.</p>

<p>The salt of the suboxide of mercury was also prepared by
double decomposition. It is a loose,
yellowish white powder. <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span></p>

<p>The salt of oxide of mercury was prepared by agitating together,
the yellow hydrate of the oxide with water and valerianic
acid. After some time, I obtained a colorless liquid,
which, upon evaporation at a temperature not exceeding 100°
Fahr., yielded crystals which, however, speedily fell into a
red powder. I therefore again repeated the operation, omitting
the application of heat; the solution was set aside, when in the
course of two or three weeks, I obtained this salt in prismatic
white crystals.</p>

<p>The bismuth salt was obtained by the addition of valerianate
of soda, to a solution of bismuth in nitric acid, which was nearly
saturated with carbonate of soda. It occurs as a loose white
powder.</p>

<p>The copper salt was obtained by double decomposition, and
occurs as a beautiful green powder.</p>

<p>The cadmium salt was prepared in the same manner as the
zinc salt. It occurs in crystalline scales, resembling in form
that of zinc, but larger.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h4><i>Combinations with Organic Bases.</i></h4>

<p>The valerianate of oxide of ethyle (valerianic ether) was obtained
by distilling, together, alcohol, oil of vitriol, and valerianic
acid; it was well washed, dried over chloride of calcium,
and re-distilled. It is an oily liquid, with a penetrating smell
of fruit, and of valerian; of specific gravity, 0,894. (Otto).
It is miscible with alcohol and ether: it has an agreeable, cool,
and aromatic taste.</p></div>

<p>I prepared the valerianate of quina, both by double decomposition,
and by direct combination of the base with the acid.</p>

<p>That by double decomposition, was prepared by adding to a
warm solution of neutral sulphate of quinine, a warm solution
of valerianate of baryta; the mixture was allowed to stand for
a while, and filtered to separate the insoluble sulphate of baryta;
the filtrate was evaporated at a temperature of about 100°,
until crystals made their appearance, when it was
set aside for <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
further cry­stal­li­za­tion. The crystals obtained by this process
are in silky tufts and perfectly white.</p>

<p>The valerianate of quina, made by the direct combination of
the acid with the base, was effected by triturating, in a mortar,
freshly precipitated quina, with water and valerianic acid,
until the quina had disappeared. It was then exposed in shallow
dishes, to a current of air; when sufficiently evaporated,
octohedral crystals were formed. Valerianate of quina in both
forms dissolves readily in water.</p>

<p>When a solution of valerianate of quina is evaporated at a
temperature of 130°, it does not crystallize, but has the appearance
of an oil.</p>

<p>From the different appearances of this salt, it is highly probable
that they each differ in composition. This phenomena is
worthy of a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>The morphia salt was prepared in the direct way. It crystallizes
in silky tufts; it dissolves readily in water.</p>

<p>Although but three of the salts of valerianic acid are employed
in medicine, namely, those of <i>peroxide of iron</i>, oxide
of zinc, and <i>quinine</i>, there appears to me no reason why those
of <i>potash</i>, <i>soda</i>, <i>ammonia</i>, <i>teroxide of bismuth</i>, and <i>oxide of
ethyle</i>, (<i>valerianic ether</i>), should not be employed by the physician.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>In conclusion, I must express my sincere thanks to Mr.
Savory, for his kindness in having placed at my disposal the
materials necessary for the preparation of this series.</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PINE APPLE.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The above essence is, as already known, butyric ether, more
or less diluted with alcohol; to obtain which pure, on the large
scale and economically, the following process is recommended:―</p>

<p>Dissolve <span class="nowrap">6
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" />s.</span>
of sugar and half an ounce of tartaric acid, in
<span class="nowrap">26 <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" />s.</span>
of boiling water. Let the solution stand for several
days; then add 8 ounces of putrid cheese broken up
with <span class="nowrap">3 <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" />s.</span>
<span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
of skimmed and curdled sour milk, and <span class="nowrap">3 <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" />s.</span>
of levigated chalk.
The mixture should be kept and stirred daily in a warm place,
at the temperature of about 92° Fahr., as long as gas is evolved,
which is generally the case for five or six weeks.</p>

<p>The liquid thus obtained, is mixed with an equal volume of
cold water, and
<span class="nowrap">8 <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" />s.</span>
of crystallized carbonate of soda, previously
dissolved in water, added. It is then filtered from the precipitated
carbonate of lime; the filtrate is to be evaporated
down to <span class="nowrap">10 <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" />s.,</span>
when <span class="nowrap">5&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> lbs.</span>
of sulphuric acid, previously diluted
with an equal weight of water, are to be carefully added.
The butyric acid, which separates on the surface of the liquid
as a dark-colored oil, is to be removed, and the rest of the liquid
distilled; the distillate is now neutralized with carbonate of
soda, and the butyric acid separated as before, with sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>The whole of the crude acid is to be rectified with the addition
of an ounce of sulphuric acid to every pound. The distillate
is then saturated with fused chloride of calcium, and re-distilled.
The product will be about 28 ounces of pure butyric
acid. To prepare the butyric acid, or essence of pine apple,
from this acid, proceed as follows:—Mix, by weight, three
parts of butyric acid with six parts of alcohol, and two parts of
sulphuric acid in a retort, and submit the whole, with a sufficient
heat, to a gentle distillation, until the fluid which passes
over ceases to emit a fruity odor. By treating the distillate
with chloride of calcium, and by its re-distillation, the pure
ether may be obtained.</p>

<p>The boiling point of butyric ether is 238° Fahr. Its specific
gravity, 0,904, and its formula
C<sub>12</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>12</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>4</sub>, or C<sub>4</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>5</sub>&#x202f;O + C<sub>8</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>7</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Bensch’s process, above described, for the production of
butyric acid, affords a remarkable exemplification of the extraordinary
transformations that organic bodies undergo in contact
with ferment, or by catalytic action. When cane sugar is
treated with tartaric acid, especially under the influence of heat,
it is converted into grape sugar. This grape sugar,
in the <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
presence of decomposing nitrogenous substances, such as cheese,
is transformed in the first instance into lactic acid, which combines
with the lime of the chalk. The acid of the lactate of
lime, thus produced, is by the further influence of the ferment
changed into butyric acid. Hence, butyrate of lime is the final
result of the catalytic action in the process we here have recommended.</p>

<h3>ON A REMARKABLE SPECIMEN OF DECOMPOSED
CHLOROFORM.
<span class="hsmall">
BY JONATHAN PEREIRA, M.D., F.R.S.,</span>
<span class="htiny">
Physician to the London Hospital.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In July of the present year I received from Mr. Grattan,
apothecary of Belfast, a specimen of chloroform, accompanied
with a note, from which the following is an extract:―</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Some weeks prior to October 25, 1851, I received from my
friend Dr. M’Killen a small bottle of chloroform which he had
had of me two or three months previously, and which he stated
was subject to very singular changes of color, despite the stopper
never having been removed.</p>

<p>At the time he handed it to me the fluid exhibited a delicate
pink tint, as though colored with cochineal, and was put aside
in a glass case in my shop, of which I kept the key myself.
The case was exposed to the diffused light of a large shop
window but not to the direct rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Conceiving that the chloroform had by some unobserved
means or other become accidentally colored, I took very little
interest in the matter, and was not surprised to find it fade
gradually, and in a short time become perfectly colorless—and
I made a note to that effect upon the 25th
of October, <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
concluding that there must have been some error of observation on
the part of Dr. M’Killen.</p>

<p>On the 16th of November, however, it again began to
change, and the enclosed notes were made, from time to time,
as I happened to have opportunity of noticing it.</p>

<p>I tried it under different conditions of light and temperature,
without their exerting apparent influence upon it, and being
unable to form the slightest conjecture as to the cause or nature
of the molecular disturbance which produces these chromatic
changes, have taken the liberty of forwarding it to you,
should you consider it worthy of attention.</p>

<p>It is at present colorless, and the stopper fast in; and I
would only suggest that, before removing the stopper, it might
be well to observe for yourself whether changes similar to
those I have noticed may not occur again.</p>

<p>The foregoing changes of color were not influenced by any
change of temperature between 27° and 86° Fahr., nor by exposure
to, nor seclusion from light. The stopper being fast,
atmospheric pressure cannot have been connected therewith.
Whether it may have been influenced by electrical changes,
am not prepared to say.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span></p></blockquote>

<p>The specimen of chloroform sent me by Mr. Grattan was, in
July, quite colorless, and on the sides of the bottle a few
minute crystals were observed. The stopper of the bottle was,
however, so firmly fixed in that I could not remove it, and I,
therefore, placed the bottle on the mantel-shelf in my library
exposed to diffused light, for the purpose of observing the
changes which its contents would undergo.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks it began to acquire a pinkish
or amethystine tint, as described by Mr. Grattan. This slightly
augmented in intensity for a few days, and then became somewhat
paler. But for several weeks, during which it remained
in the same situation, it never became colorless, though the
intensity of the color was frequently changing.</p>

<p>The color of the liquid was precisely that of a weak solution
of permanganate of potash.</p>

<p>Some weeks ago I placed the bottle in a dark cupboard, and
at the expiration of about three weeks found that the liquid
had become quite colorless. As the stopper was still immovable,
I was obliged to cut off the neck of the bottle to get at
the contents. I found that the chloroform had undergone
decomposition, and had acquired a powerful and irritating odor,
somewhat allied to, but distinct from, that of hypochlorous
acid. The vapor yielded white fumes when a rod moistened
with solution of ammonia was brought in contact with it, blue
litmus paper was reddened but not bleached by it. A few drops
of the liquid were placed on a watch glass and volatilized by a
spirit lamp; they left scarcely any appreciable residue.</p>

<p>The crystals which lined the bottle were then examined.
They were few in number, and not larger than pins’ points.
They were white, and when examined by the microscope, were
found to be six-sided pyramids, like the crystals of sulphate of
potash. Some of them were heated to dull redness in a test
tube, without undergoing any appreciable change. When
heated on the point of a moistened thread in the outer cone of
the flame of a candle, they communicated a violet-white tinge
to the flame, char­ac­ter­is­tic of a potash-salt.
They readily <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
dissolved in water, and the solution did not yield any precipitate
on the addition of a solution of nitrate of baryta, showing that
the salt was not a sulphate. The solution was boiled with
nitric acid, and then treated with a solution of nitrate of baryta,
but no precipitate was observed. Nitrate of silver produced
in the aqueous solution of the crystals a white precipitate,
soluble in ammonia, but insoluble in nitric acid.</p>

<p>Whether these crystals were in any way connected with the
change of color which this sample of chloroform underwent, I
am unable to determine; but I suspect not. I am anxious,
however, to draw the attention of others to the subject, in the
hope that larger specimens of the salt may be obtained for examination.
For at present the circumstances under which
chloroform frequently undergoes decomposition are very obscure.
Except in this instance, I have never met with, nor heard of,
any sample of chloroform which underwent these remarkable
changes of color.</p>

<p>The chloroform was transferred into another bottle, on the
sides of which a few minute crystals are now formed. But
since the removal of the stopper the pink color has not re-appeared.</p>

<p>I have written to Mr. Grattan to obtain, if possible, further
information respecting this specimen of chloroform. But he
tells me he has not any more of the sample, and has no means
of ascertaining by whom it was made, as about the time it was
purchased of him he had in his shop parcels from London,
Edinburgh and Dublin, as well as a small quantity prepared
in Belfast, and he is quite unprepared to say from which of
them it was taken.</p>

<p>I suspect that the pink color of the chloroform must have
been due to the presence of manganese. If so, was this metal
derived from the chloride of lime used in the manufacture of
chloroform? Mr. Squire informs me that he has occasionally
found the solution of chlorinated soda to become of a pinkish
hue after being prepared a few days (not immediately), and that
he has attributed it to some manganese carried
over with the <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
chlorine gas, as he does not remember having observed this
change when the gas had been passed through water before
entering the solution of carbonate of soda.</p>

<p>If this suspicion should prove well founded, it is obvious that
the purity of the chloride of lime employed in the preparation
of chloroform deserves the attention of the manufacturer.</p>

<p><i>Postscript.</i>—Subsequently to the reading of this paper before
the Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Society, I have received from Mr. William
Huskisson, jun., a specimen of pink chloroform, which, he informs
me, owes its remarkable color to the presence of manganese,
derived from peroxide of manganese employed in the
purification of chloroform, as recommended by Dr. Gregory,
(see <i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal</i>, vol. ix., p. 580.)</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Mr. W. Huskisson, jun., tells me, that he has observed in
his specimen neither the alterations of color nor the crystals
met with in the specimen sent me by Mr. Grattan.</p>

<hr class="hr12" /></div>

<p>The chairman stated, that he had never, in the various specimens
of chloroform, of which his firm had always a large
quantity in stock, observed the pink color described by
Dr. Pereira, nor had he ever seen any crystals deposited in the
bottles, but he would have a more minute examination made
with the view of ascertaining whether such existed. When the
chloroform was first drawn over, and before it was purified, it
frequently possessed more or less of a brown color, but this was
quite distinct from the character described in the paper which
had just been read.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Hanbury observed, that the use of manganese had
been suggested in the process for purifying chloroform, and its
presence might in this way be accounted for.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Mr. Barnes thought it desirable that the decomposed chloroform
should be examined for formic acid. Although constantly
subject to decomposition, no satisfactory explanation of the
nature of the change had
yet been afforded.</p>

<h3>REPORT PRESENTED TO THE ACADEMY OF
MEDICINE OF PARIS,
<span class="hsmall">
ON THE SUBSTITUTION OF AN AR­TI­FIC­IAL IO­DU­RET­TED OIL FOR COD
LIV­ER OIL.</span>
<span class="htiny">
<i>By a Commission composed of Messrs. Gibert, Ricord,
Soubeiren and Guibourt.</i></span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>On the 20th of August, 1850, the Academy appointed a commission,
composed as above, to whom was submitted a memoir,
by M. Personne, entitled, “Researches on the Cod-liver and
Skate Oils; and on the preparation of an ioduretted oil, by
which they may be replaced as Medicinal Agents.” A note
was also submitted to us on the same subject, from M. Deschamps,
and another from M. Marchall, the latter of which
claimed for the author priority in the employment of ioduretted
oil of almonds, as a substitute for cod-liver oil.</p>

<p>We proceed now to report the results of our examinations of
these communications, and of the investigations to which the
enquiry has led.</p>

<p>Cod-liver oil has long been the object of a considerable commerce
arising principally from the decided superiority which
it possesses over other animal oils, for the preparation of
chamois leather; but it has only been within about twenty
years that it has been used in medicine. It was first employed
as a remedy for rheumatic pains, then for bronchial affections,
and subsequently as a remedy for scrofula and consumption.
It now constitutes one of the medicinal agents most extensively
used, and one of those, on the action of which medical men
place the greatest reliance, as a remedy capable either of curing
very formidable diseases, or of retarding their fatal termination.</p>

<p>The most important memoir which has been published on
cod-liver oil is that of Dr. Jongh, in which three kinds of oil
are described as met with in commerce, which are called the
<i>black</i>, the <i>brown</i>, and the <i>white</i> cod-liver oil. These oils are
represented to consist, principally, of oleic and margaric acids,
and glycerine, and, as accessory bodies, of
butyric acid, acetic <span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span>
acid; some principles appertaining to the bile, a non-azotised
yellow or brown coloring matter, called gaduine, iodine, phosphorus,
and some inorganic salts. In France, Messrs. Girardin
and Preisser have been engaged in comparing the effects of the
oil obtained from the cod with that obtained from the ray; and
they advocate the superiority of the latter for medicinal use. But
this superiority seems to depend, in part, on the circumstance,
that the oil obtained from the livers of the ray, being carefully
prepared by the pharmaciens, and being transparent, and of a
light yellow color, proves less offensive to the patients than the
cod-liver oil of commerce, which is generally thick, of a dark
color, and has a disagreeable flavor. This, however, is scarcely
admitted at the present time. Moreover, it appears from recent
observations, that the above characters cannot be much depended
upon for distinguishing the two kinds of oil, in
consequence of their being so variable.</p>

<p>According to Messrs. Girardin and Preisser, these two oils
contain iodine in the state of iodide of potassium, and in
quantity much less than had been indicated by Dr. Jongh.
The latter author gives, as follows, the quantity of iodine in
1,000 parts of oil:―</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">

 <td class="pleft">Black cod-liver oil</td>

<tr>
 <td class="pleft">White cod-liver oil</td>
 <td class="pleft">0,374 parts of iodine.</td></tr>
</table></div></div><!--dtablebox-->

<p>Messrs. Girardin and Preisser have found in a litre (thirty-five
fluid ounces),</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Of ray-liver oil</td>
 <td class="pleft">0,180 gramme of iodine.</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="pleft">Of cod-liver oil</td>
 <td class="pleft">0,150 gramme of iodine.</td></tr>
</table></div></div><!--dtablebox-->

<p>According to M. Gobley, a litre of ray-liver oil, prepared by
direct action of the fire, contains twenty-five centigrammes of
iodide of potassium. M. Goodley was unable to find phosphorus
in this oil.</p>

<p>Such were the principal analytical results known when
M. Personne presented his memoir to the Academy. The uncertainty
which appeared to attach to the subject,
and the <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
variations in the statements of chemists, induced him to put to himself
the following questions:―</p>

<p>1st. Do the oils of cod and ray-liver contain iodide of potassium
or iodine?</p>

<p>2nd. Do the different sorts of these oils contain the same
proportion of iodine?</p>

<p>3rd. Do these oils contain phosphorus, to which their effects
may be partly attributed?</p>

<p>For detecting the presence of the iodine, M. Personne saponified
the oil with an excess of caustic potassa, incinerated the
soap, and treated the product of incineration with strong
alcohol. The alcohol was evaporated, the residue dissolved in
water, and to this, solution of starch and sulphuric acid were
added. The quantity of iodine was estimated by the intensity
of the color; it is too small to be estimated by the balance.</p>

<p>Mr. Personne examined in this way the dark brown and thick
cod-liver oil, such as is employed in the hospitals of Paris; the
transparent and nearly colorless oil of English commerce; and
the ray-liver oil prepared by the direct action of a moderate
heat, and subsequent filtration. The following are the results:―</p>

<p>1st. The brown cod-liver oil of the hospitals of Paris contains
more iodine than the fine white oil of English commerce.</p>

<p>2nd. It also contains more iodine than the ray-liver oil, and,
moreover, the quantity present is certainly less than a decigramme
of iodine in a kilogramme of oil (1 in 10,000.)</p>

<p>3rd. The residue of the liver, left after the preparation of the
oil, contains much more iodine than the oil itself.</p>

<p>With regard to the question as to whether the iodine exists
in cod-liver oil in the state of iodide of potassium, or directly
combined with the oil, M. Personne, while he admits the difficulty
of satisfactorily determining the point, inclines to favor
the opinion that the iodine is directly combined with the elements
of the oil.</p>

<p>[The different methods which have been suggested for the
preparation of the ioduretted oil proposed as
a substitute for <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
cod-liver oil are described. A discussion follows of the claims of
the authors, whose communications were submitted to the commissioners,
for having first introduced the artificial ioduretted
oil, which discussion is also omitted here as being uninteresting
to our readers. The commissioners next proceed to state the
result of the evidence obtained, by the medical members of the
commission, of the therapeutical action of the artificial ioduretted
oil.]</p>

<p>M. Gibert administered the ioduretted oil for periods varying
from several weeks to several months, to patients suffering
with eruptive complaints and scrofulous tumors; and, in some
instances, found the benefit to be greater than from the use of
cod-liver oil, under similar circumstances. He states, that he
does not think he has tried it in a sufficient number of cases,
and for a sufficient length of time, to enable him to state decidedly
what its absolute value is as a specific for eruptive and
scrofulous complaints; but the results he has obtained are sufficient
to prove, that it is easy of ad­min­i­stra­tion and devoid of
any injurious quality, and that it possesses a resolutive action,
which renders it a valuable remedy for certain chronic eruptions
and glandular swellings.</p>

<p>M. Ricord has employed the ioduretted oil for twelve months,
in a great number of cases of scrofula, some of which were considered
to be of venereal origin. He thus obtained excellent
results in the treatment of strumous bubo, tubercular epididymis,
and in some cases of scrofulous enlargement of the joints,
etc., and other things being equal, curable cases were cured, or
relief afforded, much more quickly by the use of the artificial
ioduretted oil than by the natural cod-liver oil.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The average dose in which the ioduretted oil was administered
was sixty grammes (<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />ij.), which was sometimes raised to
100 grammes (<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />iiiss.) The patient generally took it without
inconvenience. It was only in a few instances, where the dose
had been raised, that vomiting, colic, and diarrhœa were produced.

of every remedy be observed, and the
degrees of <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
susceptibility of the patients, together with all special conditions,
properly studied, it may be affirmed that the ioduretted oil is
a medicine of great value and that it presents considerable advantage
over the cod-liver oil.—<i>Journal de Pharmacie, in

<h4>INTERNAL USE OF ATROPINE.
<span class="htiny">
ABRIDGED FROM THE JANUARY NUMBER OF THE LONDON JOURNAL OF MEDICINE.</span></h4>

<p>In the practice of English and American physicians, atropine (atropia) has
been hitherto used chiefly as an external application, to dilate the pupil, but, as
far as we know, has never been administered internally. In France, the
powdered belladonna root has been strongly recommended as affording a reliable
and efficient preparation; in this country, the leaves and the extracts and tincture
derived from them are alone officinal. Dr. Lusanna, an Italian physician,
has ventured upon the internal use of atropia, and, according to our notions, in
very large doses. He commences its ad­min­i­stra­tion in doses of one-thirtieth of a
grain every three or four hours, gradually increasing the dose according to the
effect produced. In some instances he went so far as to give one-third of a grain
five times a day.</p>

<p>It may be given, according to Dr. L, in solution in alcohol, or in acetic or some
other mild acid. Pills and powders, from the difficulty of apportioning the dose
he deems unadvisable. The alcoholic solution has a taste somewhat like that of
quinine, but feebler, and not particularly disagreeable. The patient soon becomes
habituated to the remedy, and the dose has to be increased. In cases of neuralgia
he recommends the application of one-fourteenth to one sixth of a grain to a
blistered surface, in the form of pomade. Dr. L. carries the ad­min­i­stra­tion of
atropia so far as to produce what we would call its toxicological effects.</p>

<p>1st. <i>Dilatation and immobility of the pupil.</i> Between fourteen and fifteen
minutes after the exhibition of from one-twenty-fourth to one-thirtieth of a grain
of atropia, the pupil becomes enormously dilated. If the remedy be persevered
in the dilatation passes of, but the iris becomes immoveable, and the pupil no
longer contracts on exposure to light. When the remedy is stopped, as the other
phenomena produced by its exhibition subside, the pupil again becomes extremely
dilated. Previous to this it commences to oscillate, contracting slightly when
exposed to strong light, and dilating again in the shade. This
indicates that the <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
effects of the remedy are disappearing. The dilatation of the pupil is the last of
the phenomena to subside, being sometimes met with eight days, or more after
the suspension of the atropia.</p>

<p>2. <i>Disturbance of vision.</i> Objects at first seem hazy and ill-defined, persons are
not recognized, and it is impossible to read or write. If the dose be increased,
objects seem covered with a dark shade, and vision may be wholly lost. Every
fresh dose has a sudden and marked effect in diminishing vision, and on its suspension
the disturbance of vision disappears with equal rapidity. In one or two
days the sight is perfectly restored.</p>

<p>3. <i>Disturbance of Intellect.</i> At first the patient appears dull and stupid, then
there is vertigo and confusion of ideas.</p>

<p>4. <i>Hallucinations of sight and hearing.</i> Objects are seen double or greatly
magnified; motes and insects flit before the eyes; well known objects assume
strange and monstrous forms, or horrible phantoms are seen. The hearing is more
rarely affected. Buzzing, tinkling, hissing and whistling are sometimes heard.</p>

<p>5. <i>Anaesthesia.</i> Touch remains apparently perfect, but pain is relieved or
blunted. The patient does not seem to suffer from painful tactile impressions.</p>

<p>6. <i>Dryness of the mouth and throat</i> were invariably felt. At first this seemed a
purely nervous phenomenon, but if the medication was continued, from the
diminution of the salivary secretion it became real.</p>

<p>7. <i>The appetite</i> is early lost, and there is no thirst; but on the cessation of the
remedy it returns sharper than ever. Speech is early embarrassed, and the power
of swallowing early diminished, becomes finally lost.</p>

<p>8. <i>Delirium</i> alternating with stupor or succeeded by it, is produced by one-tenth
of a grain of atropia at the commencement of the treatment, or by one-fourth
of a grain later, or by any sudden increase of the dose. The delirium is
commonly gay and ridiculous; in one instance only was it mournful. When
these phenomena are at all intense, they subside slowly. For several days after
the cessation of the medicine, there is confusion and slowness of thought.</p>

<p>9. <i>Redness of the skin</i> was observed in but a single case.</p>

<p>10. <i>Torpor and paralytic tremblings.</i> As the patient gets under the influence
of the atropia, the legs become weak and trembling, gradually lose their strength,
and he is confined to bed. They may be still agitated by twitching, and convulsive
movements.</p>

<p>11. <i>Paralysis of the sphincters of the rectum and bladder.</i> This is the highest
point to which, according to Dr. L., the medicative action of atropia can attain.
In one case, only, the fæces and urine were passed involuntarily.</p>

<p>The functions of respiration, circulation, and calorification, were never affected
by atropia.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>After this long catalogue of serious symptoms, Dr. Lusanna rather naively observes,
he has never seen any truly alarming results arise from the use of atropia!
Should they occur, he recommends wine as
the best antidote.</p>

<span class="smcap">C<b>ULTIVATION</b></span>
 <span class="smmaj">OF</span>
 <span class="smcap">O<b>PIUM.</b></span></h4>—In
a late number of the Archives Generales de Medicine,
will be found a short notice of a paper, read by M. Aubergier, to the French
Academy of Science upon the cultivation of native opium. When the juice is
obtained according to the methods described by M. A., the seeds continue to
ripen, and the oil they yield pays the expense of cultivation. If the opium then
more than repays the expense of the labor necessary to procure it, its production
will be a source of profit. Now M. A., by successive improvements in his processes,
has been enabled to raise the amount obtained by each laborer from a
maximum of 75 to
<span class="nowrap">90 grammes</span>
<span class="nowrap">(1157&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> grs.</span> to
<span class="nowrap">1389 grs.)</span>
to five times that quantity.
The commercial value of the opium will always, therefore, more than repay
the cost of manufacture. He farther finds that the proportion of morphia contained
in the opium varies. 1st, with the maturity of the capsules from which it
is collected, opium collected from capsules nearly ripe yielding less morphia than
that obtained from those that are not so near their maturity. 2d, different varieties
of the poppy yield an opium varying in the quantity of contained morphia
from 15 to 17.833 per cent. Twenty specimens of foreign opium examined by M.
A. yielded quantities varying from 2.64 to 13 per cent.</div>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The superiority of some specimens of European opium has been noticed by
previous observers, and depends probably on the greater care bestowed on its
preparation and on the cultivation of the plant.</p>

Chromic acid has lately been employed in Germany,
both in concentrated solution and in substance, as an escharotic. The
advantages it possesses are, that it is efficient, manageable, and less painful than
the more ordinary applications. The concentrated solution is applied by means
of a glass rod, a pencil made of asbestos, or if necessary, an ordinary hair pencil,
which, if washed immediately, can be used a second time. The solid chromic acid
on account of its penetrating action has to be employed with much care. All
organic compounds are first oxydised and then dissolved in an excess of the acid,
and this change is accelerated by an elevated temperature. Smaller animals,
birds, mice, &amp;c., were so completely dissolved by the acid within fifteen or
twenty minutes, that no trace of their bones, skin, hair, claws, or teeth could be
discovered. It would thus appear to be not only a gentle and gradual escharotic,
but also a complete and rapid solvent. <i>Dublin Quarterly Jour. of Med. Science,

Iron “ad nauseam,” had taken it with benefit in Europe under
the name of “Bestucheff’s tinc­ture,” as which, it at one time enjoyed
great popularity, so that a very large sum was given to
the author in purchase of it by the Czarina Catharine. After
the com­po­si­tion became known it fell into disuse, almost justifying
us in reversing the quotation from Celsus,―</p>

<p>It presents the metal in a different chemical state from what it
is in the muriated tincture, viz: a very soluble deuto chloride;
no acid is present and there are besides the anodyne and anti-spasmodic
properties of the ethereal spirit, rendering it peculiarly
appropriate in hysterical affections; and being pleasant
to the taste and miscible with water, it is not at all repulsive.—Supposing
it may prove useful elsewhere and to others, I subjoin
the formula I have used, and to which I give the preference,
as being the most complete. It is original in the Austrian
Pharmacopœia of 1820, whence it has been copied into many
French formularies, under the name of

<span class="smcap">A<b>CACLÆ.</b></span>—Among the many useful hints
which have appeared in the New York Journal of Pharmacy,
in relation to several formulæ of the
<span class="nowrap">U. S. P.,</span> I perceive the
preparation mucilage of gum arabic has been deemed worthy of
a supervisory notice, and having experienced some annoyance
with regard to it, arising simply from the fact that the officinal
preparation has been heretofore entirely overlooked by apothecaries
generally, each one instituting a formula for himself, I
have been very much gratified by the result of adhering strictly
to the formula of the Pharmacopœia, and would take the liberty
to say that as the formulæ of all the Pharmacopœias of countries
wherein our language is spoken are alike, it surely would not
be productive of any advantage to introduce an exception to
this conformity, to suit a local peculiarity, arising, to say the
least, from inadvertence. Besides the thickness of the officinal
mucilage is not much greater than that of syrup of gum, and is
even absolutely necessary for the <i>chief proposes</i> for which it is
intended or prescribed, viz: the suspension
of weighty metallic <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
oxydes, &amp;c., and the holding balsams, oils, &amp;c., in mixtures,—much
benefit then would, so far as my experience goes, accrue
from the apothecary confining himself strictly to the officinal
mucilage, and as individual formulæ are based upon it, the re-compounding
them from transcribed versions would be rendered
more accurate. This “whittling” away of standards, to
make them correspond to the shortcomings of negligence or
parsimony, has only the effect of rendering “confusion worse
confounded.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M<b>ISTURA</b></span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>MYGDALARUM.</b></span>—Being a work of some hour or
so’s duration to prepare the almond emulsion ab initio, it has
been usual to keep the ingredients in the form of paste, from a
proportionate quantity of which the mixture is made when required.
The paste does not keep, becoming musty and sometimes
exceedingly hard. I have therefore adopted the plan of
keeping the almonds already <i>bleached and well dried</i>, in which
state they do not undergo any change and thus is made all the
preparation that can be, to expedite the process.</p>

<span class="smcap">P<b>OTASS.</b></span>—On taking up, the other day, a shop
bottle in which Fowler’s solution had been kept for some half a
score or dozen of years, I perceived it to exhale a strong garlicky
odor char­ac­ter­is­tic of free metallic arsenic. On examining
the bottle which is of the ordinary flint glass, the inner surface
presented the appearance of being coated or rather corroded,
and having a metallic lustre so far up as the bottle was generally
occupied by the solution, and in the upper part several
specks were visible, of the same character, as if they had been
produced by the sublimation of the corrosive agent. The coating
was not affected by any amount of friction nor by alkalies
but was slowly dissolved by acetic acid, from which iodide of
potassium threw down a precipitate of iodide of lead.—Deeming,
therefore, the decomposition to have arisen from the
lead contained in the flint glass I have since then kept the solution
in green glass bottles.</p>

<h3>LIQUOR MAGNESIÆ CITRATIS.
<span class="hsmall">
THOS. S. WIEGAND, PHILADELPHIA.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The attention which has been given to this article by phar­ma­ceu­tists,
both on account of its pleasantness and its great
tendency to change, has induced me to offer the following
observations.</p>

<p>The advantage of the plan proposed is that a perfectly satisfactory
article can be furnished in five or eight minutes,
thus rendering unnecessary any attempt to make the preparation
permanent at the expense of its remedial value. That this
is the manner in which the public are supplied, save at stores
where large quantities are sold, there can be but little doubt,
from the experiments of Professor Proctor of Philadelphia,
detailed in the 23rd volume of the American Journal of Pharmacy,
p.p. 214 and 216, which show conclusively that a permanent
solution of citrate of magnesia must be a decidedly acid
one.</p>

<p>Another method for making a soluble citrate has been devised
by Dorvault, which is published in his treatise, entitled “L’officine;”
but from certain difficulties in manipulation his process
cannot come into very general use.</p>

<p>The formula offered is―</p>

<p>Take, of carbonate of magnesia, in powder, five drachms,
boiling water five fluid ounces, throw the magnesia upon the
water in a shallow vessel, when thoroughly mixed, pour five
sixths of the pulp into a strong quart bottle, fitted with cork and
string for tying down; then make a solution of seven and a half
drachms of citric acid in two fluid ounces of water, pour it into
the magnesia mixture, cork and tie down immediately; when
the solution has been effected (which will require but a minute
and a half, or two minutes,) empty it into a bottle capable of
holding twelve fluid ounces, containing two fluid ounces of
syrup of citric acid, add the remaining pulp of carbonate of
magnesia, nearly fill the bottle with water,
and cork instantly, <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
securing it with twine or wire; if the carbonate be of good
quality it will be entirely dissolved in seven minutes.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Of course it is not intended that the carbonate of magnesia
can be rubbed to powder, the water boiled, the bottles washed
and fitted with strings and corks in the time above mentioned.
My plan is to have the bottles prepared with their corks, strings,
and syrup in advance, and to keep the carbonate of magnesia
in a state of powder for this purpose.</p>

For many years past a factitious balsam
Peru has been manufactured in a neighboring city in very considerable
quantities, and has entered largely into consumption;
it is made by dissolving balsam tolu in alcohol. It closely resembles
the true balsam, and is calculated to deceive unless
subjected to a close examination. If one’s attention is particularly
called to it, a smell of alcohol is perceptible. It is, however,
easily tested by burning in a spoon or small cup. The factitious
balsam readily ignites on the application of flame and burns, as
may be supposed, with a blue flame. The true balsam ignites
with much more difficulty and emits a dense black smoke, and
on the application of considerable heat, the air becomes filled
with small feathery flakes of lamp black. This test, together with
the sensible properties of appearance, taste and smell, will enable
one to determine without doubt as to its genuineness.</p>

This preparation of sulphur is made by boiling sulphur and
lime in water, and after filtering, precipitating the sulphur with
muriatic acid. It differs from the ordinary sulphur in being
in a state of more minute division and being softer and less brittle
after having been melted. <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span></p>

<p>When sulphuric acid is used to precipitate the sulphur, sulphate
of lime is formed and cannot be separated from the precipitated
sulphur by the ordinary process of washing, that salt
being insoluble in water; for this reason muriatic acid should
be used, as the salt thus formed, the muriate of lime or chloride
of calcium is perfectly soluble and can be readily separated
from the sulphur by washing.</p>

<p>The ordinary lac sulphuris of commerce, is prepared by the
use of sulphuric acid, and in consequence is found to contain a
very large proportion of sulphate of lime, or plaster of Paris.—Several
specimens examined were found to consist of nearly
equal parts of sulphate of lime and sulphur.</p>

<p>The test for the above impurity is by burning in a small cup
or spoon. The sulphur burns out entirely, leaving the impurity
unaltered. The exact amount of impurity may be determined
by weighing the substance before and after burning, and deducting
the one weight from the other.</p>

of Paris, has, in very considerable quantities entered into consumption
within a year or two past. It is difficult to determine
between the two from their appearance. The test, however,
is very simple and consists in treating the suspected article
with muriatic acid. It should dissolve perfectly with
brisk effervescence, if it be in reality pure carbonate of lime.
If it consists, wholly or in part, of sulphate of lime, the whole or
such part remains unaffected by the acid.</p>

<p>Pure muriatic acid should be used, as the commercial acid
frequently contains sulphuric acid, in which case a portion of
sulphate of lime is formed and remains undissolved.</p>

<p>Magnesia is sometimes found in this preparation, but by accident
generally and not by design, as the price of the magnesia

<p>The confusion of Babel is felt most severely in the matter of
weights and measures. Whether we consider the <i>number of
names</i> of weights and measures, the <i>similarity</i> of names, the
<i>discrepancy in amount</i> between those of the same name, or
the <i>irregular relations</i> of those of the same denomination, we
find a maze, the intricacies of which we cannot retain in our
memory an hour after we have committed them to it. Sometimes,
too, we find a farther discrepancy of a surprising nature;
as if the authorised pint should not be the exact eighth of the
authorised gallon, and so there should be two different quarts,
one of two exact pints, and one of a fourth of a gallon, as well
as a false gallon of eight exact pints, and a false pint of an
eighth of an exact gallon.</p>

Universal Dictionary of Weights and Measures. By J.
H. <span class="smcap">A<b>LEXANDER</b>.</span> Baltimore. W. Menefie &amp; Co. 158 pp. 8vo.</p></div>

<p>We cannot here trace the genealogy of this multitude;
Chaos and old night are the ancestors of them all, except those
now prevailing in France. A large number of them are of vegetable
origin, from grains of wheat, carob beans, carat seeds,
&amp;c. The Accino, the Akey, and innumerable others seem to
have had a similar origin. Most measures of length have been
derived from the human form, as foot, span, fathom, nail, &amp;c.
To originate a new measure or weight has proved much easier
than to preserve their uniformity when established. Here legislation
has been resorted to. The arm of Henry I. was measured,
and a <i>yard</i> of the same length was deposited in the exchequer
as a standard. “Thirty-two (afterwards twenty-four)
grains of well dried wheat from the middle of a good ear” were
to weigh a penny, twenty pence one ounce, and twelve ounces
a pound. Science finally carried the matter one step further,
and a yard is now
<sup>36</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>39.13929</sub>
part of the length
of “a pendulum that <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
in a vacuum and at the level of mid-tide, under the latitude of
London, shall vibrate seconds of mean time.” The metre, a
measure established by science, is
<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>10,000,000</sub>
part of the distance
from the equator to the north pole. Measures of capacity have
been still more difficult to verify, and weights, when depending
upon these last, have been involved in further difficulties.—William
the Conquerer, enacted that 8 pounds good wheat,
61,440 grains, make a gallon. In England now, 10 pounds of
water, 70,000 grains, at 60° Fahr., make a gallon. In France
a cubic decimetre of water, at maximum density, 39.2° Fahr.,
weighs a kilogramme.</p>

<p>But the impotency of law is nowhere shown more strikingly
than in its attempts to destroy spurious and useless weights and
measures. Thirty of these are said to be prevalent in Scotland
at this day; and although Magna Charta required that there
should be but one weight in all England, the assize of bread is
still regulated by a pound, 16 of which =
<span class="nowrap">17 <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2114.l.b.bar.jpg"
 width="58" height="84" alt="℔" /> 6 oz.</span> avoirdupois.
Still further, it may not always occur to us that English measures,
dry and liquid, need translating when their works are
reprinted in the United States, as much as the French measures;
for the imperial gallon, used for both dry and liquid
measures, differs from both our gallons. It contains 1.2006 of
our liquid gallons; our dry gallon contains 1.1631 of our
liquid gallons.</p>

<p>But it is in the <i>weights of the United States</i> that we are
more particularly interested. We will, therefore, take our
leave of the rest of 5,400 and more weights and measures
which Mr. Alexander has ranged in alphabetical order, from</p>

<p>A formidable array truly! From this we see that while an
ounce of cork is lighter than an ounce of gold, a pound of cork
is heavier than a pound of gold! Nay, further, let the apothecary
go to the druggist for a drachm of opium, and he will receive
and pay for a <i>drachm</i> avoirdupois, a weight unknown
even to Mr. Alexander, although in constant use in this city.
But the moment he puts it into his mortar there is not a drachm
of it! If he wishes to use a drachm in pills or tincture, he
must add more than five grains to it. Could anything be more
inconvenient or more prolific in mistakes? To prevent butter
from becoming rancid, we are told to mix with it the bark of
slippery elm, in the “proportion of a drachm (or dram) to the
pound.” Who can tell what it means? Six different proportions
might accord with this Delphic response; the most probable
is <span class="nowrap">60:7000.</span>
But the grievance to which the apothecary
is subject does not all consist in his buying by lighter ounces,
and selling by heavier. The subdivisions by which he compounds
have no reference to his convenience. Long habit
alone can save him from either laborious calculation or risk of
error. But still another chance of error comes into the account.
Two characters, <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u0292.ezh.jpg"
 width="37" height="84" alt="ʒ" /> and <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" />, are joined to
numerals, to indicate <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
quantities; a mistake of these, by either prescriber or apothecary,
may prove fatal. A case in point occurred a few years
since, well known to many of our readers. A physician, prescribed
cyanide of potassium, by a formula in which <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u2125.ounce.jpg"
 width="40" height="84" alt="℥" /> had
been printed, by mistake, for
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a" src="images/u0292.ezh.jpg"
 width="37" height="84" alt="ʒ" />.</span> The apothecary, instead of
sending him the prescription for correction, <i>as he ought to have
done</i>, put it up and sent it with the fearful monition that the
dose would prove fatal—and so it did—to the prescriber himself,
who took the dose his patient dared not touch. He died in five
minutes, a victim to a printer’s error, to his own self confidence,
to want of etiquette in the apothecary, and last, not least, to an
ill-contrived system of weights.</p>

<p>This brings us to the practical question, What is to be done?
All agree that there ought to be a reform. On this point we can
do no better than quote the close of Mr. Alexander’s preface.—“Finally,”
says he (page vii.) “if I may be allowed, in connection
with this work and its appropriate applications, to allude to
certain dreams of my own, (as they may be; although I consider
them capable, without undue effort, of a more prompt and
thorough realisation than seems to be ordinarily anticipated,)
as to the prevalence, some day, of an universal conformity of
weights and measures, I must acknowledge that such a result
was one of the ends I had in view in the original collection of
materials. Not that such a work was going to show more emphatically
than business men feel, and reflecting men know, the
importance of such an universal conformity; or that a book
whose pages deal in discords, could, of itself, produce unison;
but the first step to any harmonious settlement is, to see clearly,
and at a glance, where the differences lie, and what they are.—If
a millennial period for this world is ever to come, as many wise
have deemed, and pious prayed, it must be preceded by one
common language, and one common system of weights and
measures, as the basis of intercourse. And the way to that is
to be built, not by the violent absorption of other and diverse
systems into one, but rather by a compromise into which all
may blend. When the Earth, in her
historical orbit, shall <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
have reached that point, (as it stood ere mankind were scattered
from the plain of Shinar) and not till then, may we begin to
hope that her revolutions will be stilled, and that before long
the weights and measures of fleeting Time will be merged
and lost in the infinite scales and illimitable quantities of Eternity.”
We are not sure that we precisely understand the last
sentence, and we are sure we dissent entirely from the one
that precedes it. No compromise can be of service in bringing
about a uniformity in weights and measures. We must either
make a better system than the best extant, and ask all men to
adopt it, or if the best that human ingenuity and science can
devise is already in use, so much the better; let us adopt it
with all our heart. Is the French system this best one? We
believe it is, nor have we ever heard it called in question.—Why
then speak of a new one as desirable? We fear the suggestion
is the offspring of a national vanity, which ought to be
beneath us. We would not oppose such a motive even to the
introduction of the centigrade thermometer, which is much
more inconvenient than Fahrenheit’s, and has <i>no one</i> advantage
over it in any respect; still less should it bar the progress of a
system against which no fault can be alleged, but that it is
<i>foreign</i>.</p>

<p>We agree with our author that the introduction of a new
system is much easier than is generally supposed. It will not
be like the change of a monetary system, where the old coins
remain, mingled with the new, to perpetuate the old names.—The
change could be, by law, effected next New Year’s day,
and all inconvenience from it would be over in a month, save
some awkwardness from habit, and two more serious difficulties.
One is from the human propensity to <i>bisection</i>. Thus
the old hundredweight of 112 pounds is bisected down to 7
pounds, and the grocer will sell half this quantity,
<span class="nowrap">3&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
pounds,
at a cheaper rate than he will sell 3 pounds or 4. Unfortunately
in bisecting 100 we run down too soon to the fractions
<span class="nowrap">12&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
and 6&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>. The French have been obliged to give way to
this propensity, and divide the kilogramme in

grains as 32.
Would that 32 × 32 = 1000! Our only remedy is to change
the radix of numeration from 10 to 16, a thing impossible but to
a universal dictator. The other difficulty is in our measure for
land. This must remain in all surveyed tracts in such a shape
that 40 acres, and also 5 acres, shall be some multiple of unity.</p>

<p>But shall the apothecary wait the action of government?—This
is neither necessary nor desirable. Some relief he ought
to have speedily. If he dare not make so great an advance as to
adopt the French system, (his truest and most honorable policy,)
let all subdivisions of the avoirdupois pound be discarded,
except the grain. Introduce the chemists’ weights of 1000,
500, 300, 100, 50, &amp;c. grains, and let all prescriptions be written
in grains alone. This, perhaps, is the only feasible course.</p>

<p>We must return once more to our author before taking leave
of our readers. The motive for making the collection was one
that strikes us as new. It was for ethnological and historical
purposes. As the carat points to India as the origin of the
diamond trade, so we find in the names, mode of subdivision,
and amount of weights and measures evidences of the migrations
of races, and of the ancient and obsolete channels in which
trade once flowed. The care with which Mr. Alexander seems
to have corrected these tables, and adjusted the discordant elements
of which they are composed, and corrected the discrepancies
between them, makes them more worthy of reliance
than anything that has preceded them, and leaves little to be
desired that is within the reach of human attainment. After
the alphabetical arrangement, are given the weight and measure
systems of the “principal countries of the world,” beginning
with Abyssinia and ending with Würtemberg. And we
have only to add that the mechanical execution of the volume
is worthy of the care and labor the author has spent upon it,
unsurpassed, in fact, by any book made for use we have ever
seen.</p>

<h3>QUINIDINE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY MR. ROBERT HOWARD.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>This alkaloid, which gained a prize in the Great Exhibition,
has scarcely yet attracted much attention. Some of the cheaper
barks now largely imported from New Grenada contains so
much of it that it is, perhaps, as well that it should be more
studied. The <i>Cinchona cordifolia</i>, from this part of the continent,
is particularly rich in it. It is, however, contained in
larger or smaller quantities in the Bolivian and Peruvian barks—the
<i>Cinchona Calisaya</i>, <i>Boliviana</i>, <i>rufinervis</i>, and especially
<i>ovata</i>.</p>

<p>Referring your readers to a very able paper in your Journal,<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn10" id="fnanch10">10</a>

<p>The sulphate of quinidine, or β quinine as it is called by
some, (Van Heijninger and others,) is so like the sulphate of
quinine, that the eye or the taste can with difficulty distinguish
them. It forms the same light fibrous cry­stal­li­za­tion, and
occupies as large a bulk. It corresponds in appearance with
the description given by Winckler, of “chinidine.” (See
<i>Pharm. Journ.</i> for April, 1845, vol. iv., p. 468.) He notices
that it has “a remarkably white color and a peculiarly faint
lustre.” Its most striking char­ac­ter­is­tic is its extreme solubility.
Pure sulphate of quinine requires nearly thirty times its
weight of boiling water for solution, whilst the sulphate of
quinidine dissolves in four parts. On the other hand the pure
alkaloid crystallizes readily out of proof spirit and out of ether,
whilst quinine does not crystallize out of either. A very good
test for the presence of cinchonine in sulphate of quinine is
also capable of being applied to detect the presence of β quinine.
On this point I would refer for very interesting details
to a paper by M. Guibourt, in the <i>Journal de Pharmacie</i> for
January in this year.</p>

<p>In your Journal of April, 1843, I gave a test for sulphate of
quinine, to which I would again
advert, because subsequent <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
experience has proved it to be a tolerable easy, and at the same
time exact means of ascertaining its purity. Put 100 grains in
a Florence flask with five ounces of distilled water, heat this to
brisk ebullition; the sulphate of quinine ought not to be entirely
dissolved; add two ounces more water, and again heat
it to ebullition; ought to make a perfectly clear solution. If
this be allowed to cool for six hours, and the crystals carefully
dried in the open air on blotting paper, they will be found to
weigh about ninety grains, the mother-liquor may be evaporated
and tested with ether, when any cinchonine or β quinine
will be easily detected. On examining sulphate of quinine of
commerce from several leading manufacturers, I have found all
of them give, within a grain or two, the same result, and, in
each, indications of a β quinine, though to an unimportant
extent.</p>

<p>The above quantity of water (seven ounces) readily dissolves
800 grains of sulphate of β quinine; and if 100 grains of this
salt are dissolved in seven ounces of water, the crystals as above
weigh only fifty-four grains, thus leaving forty-six grains in
solution instead of about ten grains.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The medical effects of β quinine deserve investigation, the
chemical constitution and the taste appear to indicate a great
similarity if not identity.</p>

<h3>ON THE ADULTERATION OF SULPHATE OF QUININE,
AND THE MEANS OF DETECTION.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Mr. Zimmer, manufacturer of sulphate of quinine in Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
has published the following circular and paper
to his correspondents abroad:</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="psignature">
<i>Frankfort-on-the-Maine, Feb.</i> 6th, 1852.
</div>

<p>You are doubtless, aware that various and partly spurious
kinds of sulphate of quinine have for some time past found
their way into the market. The
substance now frequently <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
mixed with quinine is quinidine. But little positive is as yet
known of the medicinal properties of this alkaloid, and whatever
may be the result of future experiments, its arbitrary substitution
is, under any circumstances, unwarrantable, and
renders all fair and honest competition almost impossible.</p>

<p>The importance of the subject has induced me to address a
few words to you, that I may submit a simple experiment by
means of which the most usual adulterations of quinine may
readily be detected.</p>

<div class="psignature">
I have the honor to be, with much respect, &amp;c.&#160;&#160;&#160;<br />

<hr class="hr12" />

<p>The high price of genuine Bolivian <i>Cinchona Calisaya</i>,
through the monopoly of its export, has given occasion to imports,
from other districts, of <i>Cinchonas</i>, the quality of which
widely differs from that of the Calisaya, inasmuch as they
contain principally quinidine. The lower prices of these barks,
regardless of their different constituents, have brought them
quickly into use in many factories of quinine, whereby a large
quantity of quinine, containing quinidine, has got into the
market, causing an undue depreciation in the price of quinine.</p>

<p>The existence of this third cinchona-alkaloid is now established
beyond a doubt by ultimate analysis, by the peculiarity
of its salts, and by important distinctive tests; and there can
be no further question, that quinidine must, equally with cinchonine,
be distinguished from quinine. The external characters
of sulphate of quinidine differ from those of sulphate of
quinine; it has a greater specific gravity and less flocculent
cry­stal­li­za­tion. In dry warm air it parts with its water of
cry­stal­li­za­tion, without deliquescing or losing its crystallized
aspect; lastly, it is far more soluble than sulphate of quinine
in cold water and in alcohol.</p>

<p>One of the distinctive properties of the three alkaloids in
question, <i>viz.</i>, their behavior with ether—places in our hands
a ready means of detecting the mixture
of cinchonine and <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
quinidine, with quinine. Schweitzer (<i>Lond. Med. Gazette</i>,
vol. xxi., p. 175) has already employed ether for the detection
of cinchonine with complete success, and his process has, with
justice, been subsequently quoted in most manuals, as it answers
its purpose completely; cinchonine is known to be entirely
insoluble in ether, whatever may be the quantity of ether
employed. The solubility of quinidine in ether, as compared
with that of quinine, is but slight; ten grains of pure sulphate
of quinine dissolve in sixty drops of ether, and twenty drops of
spirit of ammonia, while only one grain of sulphate of quinidine
is soluble in the same quantity of the fluid; and in proportion
quinine containing quinidine will always be less soluble than
pure sulphate of quinine.</p>

<p>Guided by this fact I can recommend the following simple
and very convenient process for the detection of quinidine and
quinine:―</p>

<p>Ten grains of the salt to be examined is to put into a strong
test tube, furnished with a tight-fitting cork, to this are to be
added ten drops of diluted sulphuric acid, (one acid and five
water) with fifteen drops of water, and a gentle heat applied
to accelerate the solution. This having been affected, and the
solution entirely cooled, sixty drops of officinal sulphuric ether
with twenty drops of spirits of ammonia, must be added, and
the whole well shaken while the top is closed by the thumb.
The tube is then to be closely stopped and shaken gently from
time to time, so that the bubbles of air may more readily enter
the layer of ether.</p>

<p>If the salt examined be free from cinchonine and quinidine,
or contain the latter in no greater proportion than ten per cent.,
it will be completely dissolved; while on the surface, where
contact of the two layers of clear fluid takes place, the mechanical
impurities only will be separated (in which respect
the various sorts of commercial quinine differ.) After sometime
longer the layer of ether becomes hard and gelatinous,
after which no further observation is possible.</p>

<p>From the above statement respecting the
solubility of <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
quinidine in ether, it appears that the ten grains of the salt to be
examined, may contain one grain of quinidine, and still a
complete solution with ether and ammonia may follow; but in
this case the quinidine will shortly begin to crystallize in the
layer of ether. The last trace of quinidine may be yet more
definitely detected by employing, instead of the ordinary ether,
some other, previously saturated with quinidine, by which
means all of the quinidine contained in the quinine must
remain undissolved. It is particularly requisite in performing
this last experiment to observe, after the shaking, whether all
has dissolved, for owing to the great tendency of quinidine to
cry­stal­li­za­tion, it may become again separated in a crystalline
form, and be a source of error.</p>

<p>If more than a tenth of quinidine or cinchonine be present,
there will be found an insoluble precipitate at the limits of the
two layers of fluids. If this be quinidine, it will be dissolved
on the addition of proportionately more ether, while cinchonine
will be unaffected.</p>

<p>It is expressly to be remarked, that the necessity for testing
sulphate of quinine, in search of other fraudulent adulterations
is not superseded by the above described process.</p>

<p>We have particularly to determine upon the absence of inorganic
substances, which may be effected by subjecting to red
heat on a platinum dish, or simply by solution in alcohol. Gypsum,
chalk, magnesia, &amp;c., will be left undissolved. Boracic
acid will be dissolved by alcohol, but its green flame will indicate
its presence in the alcoholic solution when ignited.</p>

<p>The absence of organic substances, such as salicine, sugar,
stearic acid, &amp;c., may be inferred from the formation of a colorless
solution with pure concentrated cold sulphuric acid; it
is as well to leave the sulphuric acid to act for some hours.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The presence of sal-ammoniac may be detected by the addition
of caustic potash to the suspected salt, when, if present, it
will be known by the diffusion of the ammoniacal odour.—<i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal

<h3>REMARKS ON THE ENVELOPEMENT OF PILLS.
<span class="hsmall">
BY DORVAULT.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The envelopement of pills is a minute question, an accessory
in this form of administering medicines, but as it is a frequent
cause of trouble to practitioners, and as their successful operation
is often due to their peculiar mode of exhibition, we shall
perhaps be pardoned for devoting a short space to the subject.</p>

<p>In order that pills may not adhere to one another, they are
rolled in an inert powder, such as marsh-mallow, liquorice, and
above all, lycopodium. Carbonate of magnesia is now particularly
used for pills of turpentine and copaiba. To disguise the
peculiar odour of the pill mass, German practitioners use iris
powder, or cinnamon.</p>

<p>To render pills more pleasing to the eye, as well as to disguise
their taste, instead of rolling them in the before named
powders, they are frequently covered with gold or silver leaf.
The mode of doing this is too well known to need repetition.
We will only remark that those pills which contain iodine,
bromine, sulphur, iodides, bromides, sulphides, salts of mercury,
gold, platina, &amp;c., cannot be silvered.</p>

<p>These methods conceal but imperfectly the unpleasant taste
and smell of certain pillular compounds. M. Garot, to obviate
this inconvenience, has proposed to cover pills with a layer of
gelatine, by means of a process which he has made public, and
into the details of which we think it needless to enter. The
gelatinous layer conceals the bad taste and smell perfectly, but
it is attended with one inconvenience; in time it shrinks,
cracks, and the pill mass exudes. Besides, much skill is required
in its manipulation. After gelatinization comes sugaring.
This is frequently preferable to the former modes, and can be
equally well applied to pills of a repulsive taste and smell,
(copaiba, turpentine, musk, assafœtida, &amp;c.,) or to those which
are changed by air or light, (proto salts of iron,) or deliquescent,
(iod-hydrargyrate of iodide of potassium,) or caustic,
(croton oil.) It can extemporaneously be performed in the following
manner:—Put the pills into a vase with
a round bottom, <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
or into a box lined with silver, moisten them with a little syrup
of sugar, clear mucilage, or white of eggs, agitate them so as to
moisten them uniformly; add a mixture of equal parts of gum,
sugar and starch; again rotate them, so as equally to enclose
all the pills. If a first layer be not sufficient, add a second and
third in the same manner. Dry them in the air or in a stove.
In damp weather, these pills should be enclosed in corked
bottles. Gelatine of carragheen or caseine dried and powdered
may be substituted for the above powdered mixture.
This method is more expeditious than gelatinisation, and it has
besides the advantage of the material being always perfectly
soluble. Collodion has been proposed for enveloping pills, but
seems never to have been used.</p>

<p>The last method we shall call <i>toluisation</i>. It appears to
possess many decided advantages over the others. M. Blancard,
its originator, employs it particularly for pills of proto
iodide of iron. It is to induce its more general use that we
make these remarks. The following is the mode of proceeding,
which can be modified to suit the daily wants of practice:</p>

<p>Dissolve one part of balsam of tolu, in three parts of ether,
(the balsam which has been used in the preparation of syrup
of tolu will answer perfectly;) pour some of this tincture into
a capsule containing the pills, to favor the evaporation of the
ether. When the pills begin to stick together, throw them on a
mould of tin passed through mercury, or simply on a plate,
taking care to separate those which stick together. Set them
in the air to dry. The drying may be completed in a stove of
moderate heat, especially if several layers have been found
necessary. This mode of enveloping may take the place, or
nearly so, of all the others. An important point in it, is, that
it resists the effects both of damp and dryness on the pill mass.
Its balsamic odour is generally agreeable; but should it not be
so, the tolu might be replaced by some inert resin soluble in
ether, as mastic tears for example. The layer of resinous matter
is so thin, that we apprehend no obstacle in its influence
on the medicine. <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span></p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>We will, however, make one general remark, namely: that
as each method possesses some peculiar advantages, we thought
it right to give them all.—<i>Bulletin Gen. Ther. Med. et Chir.

<h3>ON THE APPLICATION OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
TO PERFUMERY.
<span class="hsmall">
BY DR. A. W. HOFFMAN.</span>
<span class="htiny">
Professor to the Royal College of Chemistry, London.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Cahours’ excellent researches concerning the essential oil of
gaultheria procumbens (a North American plant of the natural
order of the Ericinæ of Jussieu,) which admits of so many
applications in perfumery, have opened a new field in this
branch of industry. The introduction of this oil among compound
ethers must necessarily direct the attention of perfumers
towards this important branch of compounds, the number of
which is daily increasing by the labors of those who apply
themselves to organic chemistry. The striking similarity of
the smell of these ethers to that of fruit has not escaped the
observation of chemists; however, it was reserved to practical
men to discover by which choice and combinations it might
be possible to imitate the scent of peculiar fruits to such a
nicety, as to make it probable that the scent of the fruit is
owing to a natural combination identical to that produced by
art; so much so, as to enable the chemist to produce from
fruits the said combinations, provided he could have at his disposal
a sufficient quantity to operate upon. The manufacture
of artificial aromatic oils for the purpose of perfumery is, of
course, a recent branch of industry; nevertheless, it has already
fallen into the hands of several distillers, who produce sufficient
quantity to supply the trade; a fact, which has not escaped
the observation of the Jury at the London Exhibition. In visiting
the stalls of English and French perfumers at the Crystal
Palace, we found a great variety of
these chemical perfumes, <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
the applications of which were at the same time practically
illustrated by confectionery flavored by them. However, as
most of the samples of the oils sent to the Exhibition were but
small, I was prevented, in many cases, from making an accurate
analysis of them. The largest samples were those of a
compound labelled “Pear oil,” which, by analysis, I discovered
to be an alcoholic solution of pure acetate of amyloxide. Not
having sufficient quantity to purify it for combustion, I dissolved
it with potash, by which free fusel oil was separated, and determined
the acetic acid in the form of a silver salt.</p>

<div>0,3080 gram. of silver salt = 0,1997 gram. of silver.</div>

<p>The per centage of silver in acetate of silver is, according to</p>

</table></div></div>

<p>The acetate of amyloxide which, according to the usual way
of preparing it, represents one part sulphuric acid, one part
fusel oil, and two parts of acetate of potash, had a striking
smell of fruit, but it acquired the pleasant flavor of the jargonelle
pear only after having been diluted with six times its
volume of spirits of wine.</p>

<p>Upon further inquiry I learned that considerable quantities
of this oil are manufactured by some distillers, from fifteen to
twenty pounds weekly, and sold to confectioners, who employ
it chiefly it flavoring pear-drops, which are nothing else but
barley-sugar, flavored with this oil.</p>

<p>I found, besides the pear-oil, also an <i>apple-oil</i>, which, according
to my analysis, is nothing but valerianate of amyloxide.
Every one must recollect the insupportable smell of rotten
apples which fills the laboratory whilst making valerianic acid.
By operating upon this new distillate produced with diluted
potash, valerianic acid is removed, and an ether remains behind
which, diluted in five or six times its volume of spirits of wine,
is possessed of the most pleasant flavor of apples.</p>

<p>The essential oil most abundant in the Exhibition was the
pine-apple oil, which, as you well know, is nothing else but
the butyrate of ethyloxide. Even in this
combination, as in <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
the former, the pleasant flavor or scent is only attained by diluting
the ether with alcohol. The butyric ether which is employed
in Germany to flavor bad rum, is employed in England to
flavor an acidulated drink called pine-apple ale. For this
purpose they generally do not employ pure butyric acid, but a
product obtained by saponification of butter, and subsequent
distillation of the soap with concentrated sulphuric acid and
alcohol; which product contains, besides the butyric ether,
other ethers, but nevertheless can be used for flavoring spirits.
The sample I analyzed was purer, and appeared to have been
made with pure butyric ether.</p>

<p>Decomposed with potash and changed into silver salt, it gave</p>

<div>0,4404 gram. of silver salt = 0,2437 gram. of silver.</div>

</table></div></div>

<p>Both English and French exhibitors have also sent samples
of cognac-oil and grape-oil, which are employed to flavor the
common sorts of brandy. As these samples were very small,
I was prevented from making an accurate analysis. However,
I am certain that the grape-oil is a combination of amyl, diluted
with much alcohol; since, when acted upon with concentrated
sulphuric acid, and the oil freed from alcohol by washing it
with water, it gave amylsulphuric acid, which was identified
by the analysis of the salt of barytes.</p>

<p>1,2690 gram. of amylsulphate of barytes gave 0,5825 gram. of
sulphate of barytes. This corresponds to 45,82 per cent. of
sulphate of barytes.</p>

<p>Amylsulphate of barytes, crystallized with two equivalents
of water, contains, according to the analysis of Cahours and
Kekule, 45,95 per cent. of sulphate of barytes. It is curious
to find here a body, which, on account of its noxious smell, is
removed with great care from spirituous liquors, to be applied
under a different form for the purpose of imparting to them a
pleasant flavor. <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span></p>

<p>I must needs here also mention the artificial oil of bitter
almonds. When Mitscherlich, in the year 1834, discovered the
nitrobenzol, he would not have dreamed that this product would
be manufactured for the purpose of perfumery, and, after
twenty years, appear in fine labelled samples at the London
Exhibition. It is true that, even at the time of the discovery
of nitrobenzol, he pointed out the striking similarity of its smell
to that of the oil of bitter almonds. However, at that time,
the only known sources for obtaining this body were the compressed
gases and the distillation of benzoic acid, consequently
the enormity of its price banished any idea of employing benzol
as a substitute for oil of bitter almonds. However, in the
year 1845, I succeeded by means of the anilin-reaction in ascertaining
the existence of benzol in common coal-tar-oil. In his
essay, which contains many interesting details about the practical
use of benzol, he speaks likewise of the possibility of soon
obtaining sweet scented nitrobenzol in great quantity. The
Exhibition has proved that this observation has not been left
unnoticed by the perfumers. Among French perfumeries we
have found, under the name of artificial oil of bitter almonds,
and under the still more poetical name of “essence de mirbane,”
several samples of essential oils, which are no more nor
less than nitrobenzol. I was not able to obtain accurate details
about the extent of this branch of manufacture, which seems to
be of some importance. In London, this article is manufactured
with success. The apparatus employed is that of Mansfield,
which is very simple; it consists of a large glass worm,
the upper extremity of which divides in two branches or tubes,
which are provided with funnels. Through one of these funnels
passes a stream of concentrated nitric acid; the other is
destined as a receiver of benzol, which, for this purpose, requires
not to be quite pure; at the angle from where the two tubes
branch out, the two bodies meet together, and instantly the
chemical combination takes place, which cools sufficiently by
passing through the glass worm. The product is afterwards
washed with water, and some diluted solution
of carbonate of <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
soda; it is then ready for use. Notwithstanding the great
physical similarity between nitrobenzol and oil of bitter
almonds, there is yet a slight difference in smell which can be
detected by an experienced nose. However, nitrobenzol is
very useful in scenting soap, and might be employed with
great advantage by confectioners and cooks, particularly on
account of its safety, being entirely free from prussic acid.</p>

<p>There were, besides the above, several other artificial oils;
they all, however, were more or less complicated, and in such
small quantities, that it was impossible to ascertain their exact
nature, and it was doubtful whether they had the same origin
as the former.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The application of organic chemistry to perfumery is quite
new; it is probable that the study of all the ethers or ethereal
combinations already known, and of those which the ingenuity
of the chemist is daily discovering, will enlarge the sphere of
their practical applications. The caprylethers lately discovered
by Bouris are remarkable for their aromatic smells (the acetate
of capryloxide is possessed of the most intense and pleasant
smell,) and they promise a large harvest to the manufacturers
of perfumes.—<i>Annalen der Chemie.—In An. of Pharmacy.</i></p>

<h3>ON TESTS FOR THE IMPURITIES OF ACETIC ACID.</h3>

<p>Pure acetic acid is colorless, possesses strong acid properties
and taste, and no empy­reu­matic flavor. It should have, according
to the new London Phar­ma­copœia, a specific gravity
of 1.048, and one hundred grains should saturate eighty-seven
grains of crystal­lized car­bonate of soda; consequently the
phar­ma­copœial acid consists of thirty-one per cent. of the anhydrous
acid, and sixty-nine per cent. of water. It should leave
no residuum by evaporation. Sul­phu­ret­ted hydrogen, nitrate
of barytes, ferro­cya­nu­ret of po­tash, and nitrate of silver, should
produce no precipitate in it. When
it contains empyreumatic <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>

sulphuric acid causes its color to darken. Sugar, in a more or
less changed condition, is frequently one of the impurities of
the German diluted commercial acid, and may be recognized
by the taste of the residuum left upon its evaporation.</p>

<p>When sulphuretted hydrogen produces in acetic acid a milky
turbidity, it shows that sulphurous acid is present, the presence
of which is due to the decomposition of coloring and other
organic matters, contained as impurities in the acetates, from
which the acetic was prepared, when treated with sulphuric
acid. The turbidity is caused by the separation of sulphur
from the sulphuretted hydrogen, and from the sulphurous acid
by reason of the hydrogen of the former combining with the
oxygen of the latter, and forming water (Wittstein.) If the
sulphuretted hydrogen produces a black precipitate, either lead
or copper may be present. The lead may be recognized by
sulphuric acid giving a precipitate of sulphate of lead; and
the copper, by the blue reaction which ensues, with an excess
of ammonia. Sulphuric acid can be readily known when
present by nitrate of barytes producing a white precipitate,
insoluble in mineral acids. Nitrate of silver detects muriatic
acid by throwing down a white precipitate, which changes,
under the influence of light, to a violet color, and is insoluble
in nitric acid, but soluble in ammonia. Ferrocyanuret of potassium
will indicate the presence of salt of iron when by its
addition, a blue precipitate results.</p>

<p>The above tests are not applicable to the same extent to
detect the impurities of the brown vinegar of commerce, because
manufacturers are allowed by law to add to it a small
per centage of sulphuric acid, and there are always sulphates
and chlorides and other salts present in it, derived from the
water used in its manufacture; therefore, in testing for its
impurities, an allowance must be made for those which arise
from the necessary process of the manufacture, and those considered
only as adulterations which are over and above such
fair allowance. To detect such impurities
as cayenne pepper, <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
&amp;c., it is merely necessary to neutralize the vinegar with carbonate
of soda, when their presence will be palpably evident
to the taste.</p>

<p>Acetic acid may be purified by distillation from those substances
which are not volatile. By adding acetate of lead previously
to its distillation, sulphuric and muriatic acids can be
separated from it; and sulphurous acid can be removed by
peroxide of manganese, which converts it into sulphuric acid.
It can be freed from empyreumatic impurities by agitation with
charcoal, subsequent filtration and distillation.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The strength of acetic acid and vinegar cannot be determined
by the specific gravity. The power of saturating an alkaline
carbonate is the best criterion of the quantity of anhydrous
acid present in any given sample. This method will only give
correct results when the acid is pure, or when the quantities of
free mineral acids have been estimated previously by precipitation,
so as to make the necessary deductions for their saturating
power when the acid is neutralized with an alkaline
carbonate. It would be well if phar­ma­ceu­tists were more
frequently to try the strength of their acetic acid, which is
constantly sold with very plausible labels, about one part of the
acid to seven parts of water, making the distilled vinegar of
the Pharmacopœia, which statement we have oftentimes proved
to be a very pretty fiction.—<i>An. of Pharmacy, March, 1852.</i></p>

<h3>A TEST FOR ALCOHOL IN ESSENTIAL OILS.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>J. J. Bernoulli recommends for this purpose acetate of
potash. When to an etherial oil, contaminated with alcohol,
dry acetate of potash is added, this salt dissolves in the alcohol,
and forms a solution from which the volatile oil separates. If
the oil be free from alcohol, this salt remains dry therein.</p>

<p>Wittstein, who speaks highly of this test, has suggested the
following method of applying it as the best:—In
a dry test <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
tube, about half an inch in diameter, and five or six inches
long, put not more than eight grains of powdered dry acetate
of potash; then fill the tube two-thirds full with the essential
oil to be examined. The contents of the tube must be well
stirred with a glass rod, taking care not to allow the salt to rise
above the oil; afterwards set aside for a short time. If the
salt be found at the bottom of the tube dry, it is evident that
the oil contains no spirit. Oftentimes, instead of the dry salt,
beneath the oil is found a clear syrupy fluid, which is a solution
of the salt in the spirit, with which the oil was mixed. When
the oil contains only a little spirit, a small portion of the solid
salt will be found under the syrupy solution. Many essential
oils frequently contain a trace of water, which does not materially
interfere with this test, because, although the acetate of
potash becomes moist thereby, it still retains its pulverent form.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>A still more certain result may be obtained by distillation in
a water bath. All the essential oils which have a higher boiling
point than spirit, remain in the retort, whilst the spirit passes
into the receiver with only a trace of the oil, where the alcohol
may be recognized by the smell and taste. Should, however, a
doubt exist, add to the distillate a little acetate of potash and
strong sulphuric acid, and heat the mixture in a test tube to
the boiling point, when the char­ac­ter­is­tic odor of acetic ether
will be manifest, if any alcohol be present.</p>

<h3>CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF RESIN OF JALAP.
<span class="hsmall">
BY B. SANDROCK.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>It is a well known fact that when resin of jalap is treated
with ether, we obtain two kinds of resin, one soluble, and the
other insoluble in ether. Dr. Kayser chose first for his analysis
that part of the resin which is insoluble in ether. This resin,
purified by means of charcoal, was friable, almost colorless,
without smell or taste, insoluble in ether and
water, but easily <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
dissolved by spirit of wine; the alcoholic solution reddens
litmus slightly. The resin, again precipitated by water, was
perfectly soluble in solution of caustic ammonia and acetic acid.
This resin was dissolved with difficultly in cold solutions of caustic
potash and soda, but was perfectly soluble when hot, and
could again be readily precipitated from the alkaline solutions
by acids. The solution of this resin, in ammonia was of a bright
brown color, and became neutral by volatizing the superfluous
ammonia. It is consequently a resinous acid, which is distinguished
from other resinous acids, by the facts that it does not
precipitate the bases from metalic salts, such as nitrate of silver,
sulphate of copper; it afforded only a precipitate when acted
upon by basic-acetate of lead. A question arose, whether the
resin of jalap, dissolved in alkaline fluids, undergoes any
changes in its constitution. To answer this question, Kayser
undertook several analyses, the results of which were as follows:
The uncombined resin of jalap gave C 42, H 35, O 20.—The
resin, precipitated by oxide of lead, gave C 42, H 36, O 21.
It is evident that resin of jalap, combined with the bases
of salts, acquires the elements of one equivalent of water. Dr.
Kayser, has named the unchanged resin of jalap, rhodeoretin,
and that modified by bases of salts, hydro-rhodeoretin.</p>

<p>By dissolving rhodeoretin in absolute alcohol and submitting
the solution to the action of chlorine, and subsequently adding
water to it, Kayser obtained an oily fluid, dark yellow, possessing
a pleasant smell, easy to be volatilized by heat, soluble
in water, which he called rhodeoretin oil.</p>

<p>The part of the resin soluble in ether, possesses eminently
the disagreeable smell of jalap, a prickly taste; its solution
reddens litmus, and in drying leaves a greasy spot on paper;
it is soluble in alkaline fluids. If the alcoholic solution is
allowed to stand, mixed with water, for a lengthened period,
prismatic crystalline needles are precipitated. According to
these properties, Kayser includes the soluble jalap resin among
the fatty acids. Sandrock in general agrees with Kayser; but,
according to his analysis, the jalap can be
resolved in three <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
different resins, one soluble in ether, the second obtained by
precipitating the alcoholic solution by oxides of lead; the third
remains unprecipitated in this solution.</p>

<p>That part of the resin which is insoluble in ether, but is precipitated
from the alcoholic solution by oxide of lead, Sandrock
calls alpha resin; that which is not precipitated, beta resin;
that part which is soluble in ether he calls gamma resin.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The alpha resin agrees in its properties with Buchner’s and
Herberger’s jalapine. Sandrock calls ipomic acid, the produce
of this resin when treated by boiling carbonated alkaline solution;
and the one obtained in the same way from beta resin,
jalapic acid. The gamma resin forms in ether a yellow solution,
and a purple one in concentrated sulphuric acid.—<i>Archiven

<h3>ON THE PREPARATION OF CHLOROFORM FROM
THE ESSENCES OF LEMON, COPAIBA, PEPPERMINT
AND BERGAMOTTE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY M. CHAUTARD,</span>
<span class="htiny">
Professor of Chemistry at the Lyceum of Vendome.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>M. Chautard, after having completed his experiments for
the production of chloroform by means of oil of turpentine instead
of alcohol, led by analogy, proceeded to try by a similar
method to prepare it by means of the essences of lemon, bergamotte,
copaiba and peppermint, and succeeded. However,
the quantity of essences upon which he acted was too small to
carry on a minute analysis. In the meanwhile, his researches
led him to discover formic acid in the calcareous residuum of
the operation. It was already known, M. Chautard observes,
that oil of turpentine, when old and exposed a long time to the
action of the air, was transformed into formic acid, which observations
is due to M. Wappen. On the other hand, M.
Schneider, by collecting the volatile products
of the oxidation <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
of turpentine, by means of nitric acid, detected therein the
presence of acetic, metacetic, and butyric acids. Finally, a
few years ago, Mr. William Bastick<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanch11">11</a>
showed that hypo-chlorite
of lime, by reacting upon neutral unazotised bodies, such
as sugar, starch, &amp;c., gave rise to the formation of a certain
quantity of formate of lime; hence, turning to advantage the
details given by this chemist, M. Chautard continues—I thus
have carried on my operation:―</p>

<p>After having ascertained, by means of the solution of indigo,
that the residuum contained in the alembic did not contain any
hypochlorite of lime, the presence of which would have prevented
the extraction of formic acid, I threw the whole upon a
cloth, and added sulphuric acid to the filtered liquor to precipitate
the lime retained in a state of chloride or formate.—This
liquor, after having been filtered anew, was distilled, and
the product was a mixture of formic and hydrochloric acids,
which I saturated by means of carbonate of soda. By subsequent
evaporation to dryness, I succeeded, by adding afterwards
a little water, in separating the formate of soda from the chloride.
By means of the formate of soda, I proved the principal
properties of formic acid, and besides, produced from it the formate
of silver, which is decomposed by a boiling heat, leaving
a precipitate of metalic silver.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>In finishing this communication, I must observe that fixed
oils, treated in the same way by hypochlorite of lime, do not
produce chloroform; however, the reaction which occurs is so
strong, and indicative of interesting results, that it induces me
to continue my experiments.—<i>Journal de Pharmacie.</i></p>

previously dried in the vessel by a strong fire without melting;
the iron vessel must have a cover to enclose both vessels, so
that the chloride of calcium can absorb the vapor from the extract
without communication with the air, and must be put

calcium. Let it stand for some days. Remove the extract,

The apothecaries of the United States are in an
anomalous and exceptional position. Exercising functions which concern the life
and health of those who require their services, the public expects them to possess
the experience, the varied requirement, the high moral qualities which the proper
exercise of their profession demands; yet this same public, itself incapable of
discriminating between knowledge and ignorance, furnishes them no aid in the
pursuits of their studies, and yields them no protection against quackery and
imposture. Everything is left to the spirit of trade, and to the laws of supply
and demand. The advances that have been made in pharmacy have come from
within itself, unaided by any assistance from the state governments, and looked
upon often with coldness or distrust by the public. In this way, in some of the
large cities, with the influence of the sister profession of medicine, something has
been done; but, even there, how much remains to be accomplished before pharmacy
can assume the rank it holds in France and Germany!</div>

<p>As heretofore, so now, the best and the only prospect of progress in the profession
lies in itself. It best knows its necessities and requirments, and it can best devise
the remedies that will meet them. It is in the union of its members, in mutual
association and intercourse, in the formation of a public opinion
of its own, which, <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
operating first upon the members of the profession, will necessarily have its
weight upon the public opinion of the community, that lie our best hopes.
Pharmacy is at once a liberal art, and a trade. In individuals, particularly in a
community like ours, the spirit of trade is apt to be in the ascendant. Science is
estimated at its money value, for what it brings in, rather than for what it is. But
when the best men of a profession meet together, science resumes its proper position;
they are encouraged in their noblest aims, and that encouragement is
spread widely among their fellows. Individuals struggling, isolated throughout
the country, feel that there is a tribunal to which they can appeal, and by which
they will be judged, and its influence will be felt too by another class, as a restraint,
if not an encouragement. Success, obtained by worthy means, loses much
of its value, when it costs the esteem of those with whom we are most intimately
connected.</p>

<p>It is from such considerations that we look upon the approaching convention at
Philadelphia, as a step in a very important movement. A great deal depends
upon its success, and every one who has the interest of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal science
at heart, should do all he can to promote it.</p>

<p>To prove all that is hoped for by its friends, the convention should be a national
one, not only in name, but in reality. Every institution and society entitled
under the requisitions of the call, should appoint delegates, and above all, they
should appoint delegates who will attend. But there are many apothecaries
scattered through the country, in places not entitled to appoint delegates, who
may be enabled to be present at the meeting of the convention, and we are glad
to see that our Philadelphia brethren are prepared to welcome them in a liberal
and cordial spirit. They will both receive and communicate benefit. Their
presence will add weight and authority to the convention; while, independent
of its official proceedings, they cannot but derive advantages from acquaintance
and intercourse with the numerous able members of the profession who will, as
delegates, attend the meeting.</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the selection of delegates; they should not
only, above all, be men who will attend, but men who have at heart the position
and advancement of phar­ma­ceu­tists.</p>

<p>We hope that their election will take place as early as possible, that they may
have time fully to consider the objects of the convention, and the wants and
wishes of the institutions they represent. It would be well, too, if early notice of
their election should be communicated to Mr. Proctor, or some other of the members
residing at Philadelphia, and their names should be published. The convention
will have much to discuss and determine upon, while its duration will
necessarily be limited. Were the names of its members early announced, an
interchange of opinion might take place between, not to forstall the active of the
convention, but to promote and expedite it. For this purpose, if deemed desirable
our own columns are freely tendered.</p>

<h3>ON THE PREPARATION OF PURE BARIUM COMPOUNDS.
<span class="hsmall">
BY HENRY WURTZ.</span></h3>

<p>The preparation of the compounds of barium in a state of
absolute purity is a subject which has not generally received
much attention from Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal chemists, in consequence
of the hitherto limited application of these compounds, except
in chemical analysis. The time, however, is undoubtedly close
at hand, when new developments in the arts, will create a demand
for pure barium compounds, as well as for very many
other products now considered as pertaining exclusively to the
laboratory. Indeed, efforts have already been made to introduce
the <i>chlorate of barytes</i> to the notice of pyrotechnists as a
means of producing a green fire unequalled in beauty, and the
pure carbonate has been for some time in use in England, in
the manufacture of superior varieties of plate and flint glass.
The precipitated or purified native sulphate is also preferred
as a water color pigment to white lead, being far more durable
than the latter. I may here be permitted to mention a practical
application of the carbonate which has occurred to myself.
I have found that sulphate of lime is totally precipitated from
its solution by mixing therewith an equivalent quantity of the
precipitated or finely pulverized natural
carbonate of barytes, <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
of course with the formation of sulphate of barytes and carbonate
of lime. It is by no means improbable that this property
may be made available in removing sulphate of lime from
spring or sea water which is to be used in steam boilers, thus
preventing the formation of the troublesome incrustation which
so often occurs, especially when it is considered that the sulphate
of barytes which would be formed, might easily be reconverted
into carbonate and used over again. Again, sulphate
of lime might be removed in the same way from the brine in
salt works, thus contributing to the purity of the salt produced.</p>

<p>Recent improvements in chemical analysis have greatly increased
the usefulness of barium compounds in the laboratory,
especially of the carbonate, to which the late investigations of
Professor H. Rose, and of Ebelmen have given a place in the
very first rank among the reagents valuable to the chemist.
Any suggestion, therefore, concerning the preparation of barium
compounds in a pure state, cannot be considered as useless.</p>

<p>The sulphate of baryta is the only compound which occurs
in sufficient abundance to be an economical source of the other
barium compounds, and the enormous though illegitimate use
of this substance in the adulteration of white lead, is so far fortunate
as to render it an easy matter to obtain it in any required
quantity, already in a state of fine powder which is so
desirable in chemical operations.</p>

<p>The sulphate of baryta is always reduced to the state of sulphide
of barium, by exposing it to a red heat in intimate
admixture with some carbonaceous substance, such as powdered
charcoal, rosin, oil or flour. It is exceedingly difficult, however,
if not impossible, to effect in this manner a complete
decomposition of the sulphate. Indeed, it is probable that in
most cases the quantity of sulphide obtained, is not more than
half that which is equivalent to the sulphate employed. A
modification which promises to be far more economical was
proposed by Dr. Wolcott Gibbs. His proposal was to submit
the sulphate to the action of a current of common coal gas at a
red heat. It is evident that in this way
a perfect decomposition <span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span>
may readily be accomplished, especially if the powdered sulphate
is stirred during the operation, so as to expose fresh surfaces
to the action of the gas.</p>

<p>The mass obtained after the reduction of the sulphate is
submitted to the action of boiling water, and a solution obtained,
which, according to Professor H. Rose,<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn12" id="fnanch12">12</a>
contains principally
hydrate of baryta and sulphohydrate of sulphide of barium
BaS. HS. formed by the reaction of equal equivalents of water
and proto-sulphide of barium. It almost invariably contains
also a quantity of lime, probably in the form of sulpho-hydrate
of sulphide of calcium, or of hydrate of lime, proceeding from
the almost constant concurrence of sulphate of lime with native
sulphate of baryta. From the presence of this lime originates
the principal difficulty in preparing pure barium compounds
from this substance. Thus when the carbonate is prepared
from the solution by precipitation, with carbonate of soda, or a
current of carbonic acid gas, it is found contaminated with carbonate
of lime, which is fatal to its use as a reagent in analysis.
Also in examining many specimens of commercial <i>chloride of
barium</i>, which is prepared from this solution by the addition of
chloro-hydric acid, boiling to separate sulpho-hydric acid gas
which is evolved, filtration to separate the sulphur which is
precipitated and cry­stal­li­za­tion, I have always found it to
contain a small quantity of chloride of calcium, which I have
found it impossible to separate entirely by repeated recry­stal­li­za­tions.
It has been proposed<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanch13">13</a>
to separate the chloride of
calcium from chloride of barium by the use of very strong alcohol,
in which the latter when anhydrous, is insoluble. This
method is rather expensive and troublesome as it involves the
evaporation to dryness of the chloride of barium solution, the
reduction of the previously ignited residue to a very fine powder
and digestion in strong alcohol. Attempts were made after
some previous experimentation, in which it was
found that an <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
aqueous solution of <i>oxalate of baryta</i> precipitated chloride of
calcium, but not chloride of barium, to separate the lime from
a chloride of barium solution by addition of oxalate of baryta,
or simply of a little oxalic acid, but it was soon found that oxalate
of lime was somewhat soluble in a solution of chloride of
barium, so that a solution of oxalate of baryta, gave no precipitate
in a mixture of solutions of chloride of barium and chloride
of calcium. It was found also that the precipitate formed by
a little oxalic acid in a lime solution, could be re-dissolved by
addition of chloride of barium. It may also be mentioned,
though irrelevant to the subject, that it was found that oxalate
of lime was soluble in solutions of chloride of calcium, of ammonia,
and of chloro-hydrate of ammonia.</p>

<p>The well known property of carbonate of baryta which the
recent investigations of Professor H. Rose have rendered so
important in the analysis of phosphates, of completely precipitating
lime from its solution by a sufficiently long contact therewith,
furnishes us, however, with a perfectly easy and cheap
method of purifying the chloride of barium solution. In fact a
solution of chloride of barium to which chloride of calcium has
been added, having been treated with a little carbonate of baryta,
and allowed to stand in contact with it for two days, with
occasional agitation, was found on filtration to be free from
lime. The only objection to this method, is the considerable
length of time required; but I must here describe an elegant
modification which was communicated to me by Dr. Wolcott
Gibbs, and tested by him in his laboratory; that is to add first
to the solution of chloride of barium containing lime, a little
solution of hydrate of baryta and then to pass through it a current
of carbonic acid gas. The precipitate immediately formed
contains of course all the lime.</p>

<p>The only impurity which is prevalent in commercial chloride
of barium besides lime, is strangely enough, a trace of <i>lead</i>
which is almost always present and sometimes in such quantity
that the solution is immediately
blackened by sulphuric <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
acid.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn14" id="fnanch14">14</a>
This is, however, very easily removed, either before or
after the separation of the lime by the process of Dr. Gibbs, by
passing a little sulpho-hydric acid gas into the solution, gently
heating for a short time and filtering.</p>

<p>Commercial chloride of barium thus purified is probably the
most convenient source of the other compounds of barium when
required pure. Thus pure carbonate of baryta may be prepared
from it by precipitation with carbonate of ammonia, or with
carbonate of soda, which is free from silica, sulphuric acid and
phosphoric acid.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn15" id="fnanch15">15</a></p>

<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch14" id="fn14">14</a>
It may be that leaden pans are used for the evaporation
or cry­stal­li­za­tion of the commercial chloride of barium, which would
sufficiently account for the presence of lead in the product.</p></div>

<h3>RESULTS OF THE EXAMINATION OF SEVERAL
PARCELS OF ALEPPO SCAMMONY.
<span class="hsmall">
BY B. W. BULL.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Since the publication of an article upon Virgin Scammony
in a previous number of this Journal, I have had an opportunity
of examining four different varieties of scammony received
from Constantinople, under the names, Aleppo Scammony,
first; Aleppo Scammony, second; Tschangari Scammony and
Skilip Scammony.</p>

<p>No. 1. <i>Aleppo Scammony, first</i>. This occurs in large amorphous
pieces weighing one or more pounds; is not covered
with any calcareous powder. The fractured surface presents a
dark greenish resinous appearance. The specific gravity will
be found below. The caseous odor is not so
decided in this <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
specimen as in some of the other varieties, confirming, as will
be seen from its composition, as adduced farther on, the remark
made in the article above alluded to, in regard to the insecurity
of relying upon the odor as a means of judging of the quality
of scammony.</p>

<p>No. 2. <i>Aleppo Scammony, second.</i> Of this a sample of about
one pound was received. This is in amorphous pieces; it differs
from the previous specimen in its fracture which is non-resinous
and horny, it is of a much lighter color, and has a
grayish tinge. The scammony odor is more decided. This
variety receives the prefix <i>Aleppo</i> improperly, as it does not
come from that locality, and is said to be made by pressing
the root, though the quantity of insoluble organic matter
which it contains, seems to indicate some other impurity, intentionally
added.</p>

<p>No. 3. <i>Tschangari Scammony</i>, derives its name from the
place of production. It appears to be a variety not found in
market here. It resembles in fracture the last mentioned, and
is like that, in amorphous pieces. Its odor is more decided
than that of any of the others.</p>

<p>No. 4. <i>Skilip Scammony.</i> This specimen appears to have
undergone some deterioration, and evinces a disposition to
mould. Some of the pieces are marked exteriorly, as if placed
in a bag when soft, and dried in this way. It is destitute of the
caseous odor, and has a mouldy smell. Fracture, non-resinous,
and grayish, like the last mentioned varieties.</p>

<p>These three latter varieties are always to be obtained in Constantinople,
we are informed, while the first quality Aleppo, is
only produced in small quantity, and is soon out of market.</p>

<p>The difference in composition of the different varieties will
be found annexed, the numbers referring to those given above.
All of them indicate the presence of starch by the test with
iodine. <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span></p>

<h3>WHAT IS MONESIA?
<span class="hsmall">
BY E. DUPUY,</span>
<span class="htiny">PHARMACEUTIST, NEW YORK CITY.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Dorvault in the <i>Officine</i> gives it “as the product of a foreign
bark never found in commerce, but described by Mr. Bernard
Derosne, (who, according to the same authority is the
only possessor of it,) as being found in voluminous thick pieces,
filled with extractive. The color is dark brown, excepting the
epidermis which is grayish. It contains tannin and a red coloring
matter, analoguous to cinchonic red, also an acrid one and salts.”
Virey attributed it to a <i>Chrysophi lum.</i>; Martens says it is
the <i>Mohica</i> of the Brazilians; according to Mr. Constant Berrier,
it bears in that country sundry other names: <i>furanhem</i>,
<i>guaranhem</i>, <i>buranché</i>, etc. Duchesne in his <i>Répertoire des
Plantes utiles et Vénéncuses du Globe</i>, and Descourtils in his
<i>Flore médicale des Antilles</i> mentions the <i>Cainito Chrysophillum</i>
the bark of which is tonic, astringent
and febrifuge. In <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
examining some extract of Monesia I was struck with the striking
resemblance in its properties with the extract of logwood,
(<i>Hematoxylon Campechianum</i>) both possessing the same astringent
sweetish taste, precipitating salts of iron, etc. Descourtils,
who practiced medicine for a long time in the West
India islands, says “it is recommendable in dysentery and
diarrhea after the inflammatory period.” and to that effect prescribes
the decoction of one ounce of the wood or a drachm of
the extract added to an infusion of orange tree leaves, or Cascarilla
bark, per diem. Besides, Dr. Wood in the U. S. Dispensatory,
mentions its frequent use in some parts of the United
States, “in that relaxed condition of the bowels, which is apt to
succeed to cholera infantum,” and also in the same complaints
as mentioned by Descourtils. Though both the decoction of the
wood and the solution of the extract are officinal in our national
Pharmacopeia, so far as my means of observation go, they are
seldom, if ever, prescribed in New York, and yet I have repeatedly
prepared solutions of the Monesia, prescribed by our city
practitioners. The extract of log-wood being so similar in its
medicinal action, I am strongly inclined to think that it is the
same substance, though perhaps obtained from other sources;
and as the price of it is so much higher than that of the other,
it would be desirable to obtain the results of comparative experiments
made to test their relative value, and whether the
extract of <i>Hematoxylon Campechianum</i> should not be prescribed
as answering for all therapeutical purposes, the mysterious
Monesia of Derosne?</p>

<h3>THE PHARMACOLOGY OF MATICO:
WITH FORMULA FOR ITS PREPARATION.
<span class="hsmall">
BY DORVAULT.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>As matico is daily attracting more and more the attention of
practitioners, its pharmacology demands consideration. It is
well known that this new Peruvian plant has been lauded as an
efficacious remedy in leucorrhea and gonorrhea, as a vulnerary,
and above all as an excellent hemostatic, both external and
internal.</p>

<p>We shall, in the present paper, content ourselves with making
known the principal phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal forms which this substance
is capable of assuming, reserving all other considerations
for a later period. A long and careful experience will be needed
to establish the relative value of each of the subjoined forms.</p>

<h4>POWDER OF MATICO.</h4>

<p>Matico can be easily reduced to an impalpable powder. This
powder is of a yellowish green, and its odor, when fresh is more
fragrant than that of the plant itself. To preserve it well, it
should be kept in well stopped bottles.</p>

<p>Matico powder can be advantageously used externally in
sprinkling over bleeding parts, in plugging the nasal fossœ and
in epithems for contusions. Internally it may be used moistened
with a little sweetened water under the form of electuary
or in pills.</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">
<h4>INFUSION OF MATICO.</h4>

</table></div></div><!--dtablebox-->

<p>Let it infuse until cold and strain it. This infusion is amber-colored,
and possesses the aromatic odor of the plant. It is not
unpleasant to take, but may be rendered more agreeable by
the addition of sugar, or an appropriate syrup.</p>

<p>For external use, lotions, embrocations, lavements and injections,
30, 40 or even 50 grammes of matico may be
used to the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
same quantity of water, and it may be submitted to a slight
decoction. If, in this mode of operation, it parts with some
volatile oil, it gains a small portion of resin.</p>

<div class="dtablebox"><div class="nowrap">

<p>Draw off by distillation, 500 parts of hydrolate.</p>

<p>The product is colorless throughout the distillation, except
the first few drops, which are milky.</p>

<p>Hydrolate of matico has an odor of turpentine stronger than
the plant itself. It is covered with globules, or a light layer of
a volatile oil, almost colorless, and of the consistence of castor
oil.</p>

<p>If the volatile oil be, as authors have advanced, one of the
active principles of matico, then the hydrolate must be to a
certain extent efficacious. The hemostatic waters of Binelli,
Broechieri, Tisseraud, &amp;c., over their property to the volatile
oil of turpentine.</p>

<p>The hydrolate may be employed both externally and internally.</p>

<h4>EXTRACT OF MATICO.</h4>

<p>The one which appears to us the preferable is the hydro-alcoholic.
Introduce some rather coarse matico powder into the
apparatus for lixiviation, pour on it the alcohol at 56° so as to
imbibe all the powder, leave it 24 hours, open the lower cock,
pour the same alcohol over the same matico, until the latter is
exhausted, and then evaporate the liquid in the vapour bath, till
it is brought to the consistence of an extract. The product is
black, with a marked odor of matico, and a bitter taste. It is
only partially soluble, either in alcohol or water.</p>

<p>The extract of matico may be used internally in the form of
pills, lozenges, syrup and electuary, and externally, dissolved
or softened in the form of plasters, embrocations, plugs, lavements
and injections.</p>

<p>Matico furnishes about <sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub>

extract.</p>

<p>Distil till you obtain 100 parts. Draw off the residue from
the retort, press the matico, add to the product 700 parts of
sugar; mix it so as to have by the addition of the hydrolate a
syrup of ordinary consistence; filter it by Demarest’s method.</p>

<p>Thus prepared, matico syrup is brownish, limpid and of an
aromatic taste, which is not disagreeable; it contains all the
principles, active, volatile or fixed, of the substance.</p>

<p>It may be administered pure, or diluted with water. It is
one of the easiest and most efficacious modes of administering
matico in cases of internal hemorrhage or of flour albus.</p>

<p>It represents 1-10 of its weight of matico. The spoonful being
30 grammes, would represent 2 grammes; the tea-spoonful
being 5 grammes, would represent <sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> gramme.</p>

<h3>CHEMICAL RESEARCH ON CROTON OIL.
<span class="hsmall">
BY M. DUBLANC.</span> <span class="htiny">
Director of the Laboratory of the
Central Pharmacy of the Parisian Hospitals.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Some interesting researches have been instituted to ascertain,</p>

<ul class="ulin1">
<li class="lihanga"><i>a.</i> Whether the croton oil contains within itself an acid
volatile at a low temperature?</li>

<li class="lihanga"><i>b.</i> Is this acid the principle of its action, and can it be preserved
if it be separated from the oil, and diminished
if it be allowed to evaporate?</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to answer both questions, the following operations
have been instituted by this chemist.</p>

<p>The seeds of croton, deprived of their husks, ground at the
mill, and subject to pressure, yield a certain quantity of oil.—If
the residuum be mixed with double its quantity of alcohol
and pressed again, it yields a liquid which is a
mixture of oil <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
and alcohol. This liquid, when distilled, will yield more oil.
Both oils are filtered, after having been allowed to settle.</p>

<p>The produce of this first operation is the natural croton oil,
such as it exists in the seeds, which is of a brown amber color, viscid,
having a peculiar smell, and possessed of great acidity, by
which if applied to the skin, it produces an irritation varying
in intensity according to its quantity, and the duration of time
during which it has been applied. One drop, for instance,
causes a blister in twelve hours.</p>

<p>If a piece of litmus paper be dipped in this oil, it turns red,
and re acts acid; and the red color, though not deep, resists
the action of the air and of a hot furnace.</p>

<p>The oil obtained by distillation from a solution in alcohol is
rather more dark, viscid, and acid, than that obtained by simple
expression.</p>

<p>The blue paper dipped in the oil obtained by distillation,
reddens, and retains the color under the same circumstances as
the former.</p>

<p>The second operation, however, offers already a fact which is
of great value in deciding the question about the acidity of the
croton oil. If you dip the litmus paper in the fluid which is
gained by distillation, no traces of a change of color is visible;
when, on the other hand, if you dip it in the oil which remains
in the distilling apparatus, it changes the color as quickly as if
dipped in the oil previous to distillation. The same is the
case if the residuum is again acted upon with water or alcohol,
the distilled fluid has no traces of acidity.</p>

<p>However, since the contrary opinion is entertained by good
authorities, we must add other facts in corroboration of our own.</p>

<p>Croton oil was extracted by the action of ether upon the
seeds. The ethereal solution containing croton oil in suspension
was acid: it was placed in a glass vessel with two openings.
One of them admitted a straight tube, and reached to the bottom
of the vessel, admitting the introduction of external air:
the other communicated with
Woulfe’s apparatus, composed, <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span></p>

<p>1. Of the globular tube after Liebig, containing blue solution
of litmus.</p>

<p>2. Another globular tube filled with alcohol.</p>

<p>3. An angular tube in connection with a large vessel full of
water, giving an inferior running to the liquid, and causing the
air to pass across the thick layer of ethereal oil, to lead the
volatile principles in contact with the liquor destined to retain
them. The apparatus being arranged, it was put in action by
causing the water to run which was contained in the large vessel.
The vacuum having begun, air was introduced to the bottom of
the ethereal liquid, keeping up this action till the ether was totally
evaporated. Consequently, the air has agitated the liquid long
enough to remove in a state of vapour all the ether which was
contained in the mixture. Nevertheless, the tincture of Turnesol,
which opposed the passage of the vapours of ether and
water, did not change into red, which would have happened if
the volatile principles should have contained any acid. Neither
did the alcohol which was acted upon by the same current exhibit
any sign of acid. The air saturated with ether arrived in
the vessel to replace the water had no acid property; its action
upon the eye-lids and nostrils was pungent and irritating, but
not that of an acid. Another experiment was made with the
same apparatus, having always in view to cause a great quantity
of air to pass through croton oil. But this time, instead of
causing the current to pass through a mass of ethereal solution,
it was caused to pass through pure croton oil. The large vessel
was this time not quite filled with water, allowing space to
introduce on its upper part two sponges, one filled with oil,
the other with ether. Things being thus arranged, the liquid
was set running, and the air rushed through the oil, coming in
at the bottom of the liquid and spreading through the surface,
causing a lengthened ebullition. The mass of air employed in
this operation was not below two centimetres. The tincture of
litmus contained in the globular tubes was not altered; the oil
contained in the sponge was neither acid, pungent, or corrosive.
The ether acted upon by too much air
had disappeared, the <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
sponge was dry. These two proofs appear to be conclusive,
and to show that the croton oil does not contain an active volatile
acid, otherwise it would have been made manifest by being
carried away by the ether in the first case, or by its proper
volatility in the second.</p>

<p>Is it, however, possible to separate the active volatile principle
from the mere neutral oil? It has been said by several
authors that the croton oil was composed of two different oils,
but this was a mere statement which required to be proved by
facts. To solve this problem, the oil employed in the experiments
was obtained by means of ether. The seeds of croton
yield by expression 35 per cent.; treated by ether, they
yield from 52 to 55 per cent. If treated by ether, the
ether obtained by distillation is free from acid, all the acid remaining
in the oil. When a certain fixed quantity of this oil
is put in contact with ten times its weight of strong alcohol, the
alcohol dissolves 6 per cent. of its own weight, and the oil 50
per cent.</p>

<p>The portion of the insoluble oil has lost its color, its smell, a
part of its pungency, and all its acidity.</p>

<p>The portion of oil which has been dissolved in alcohol, when
separated from this menstruum by evaporation, is more viscid,
more colored, more pungent, and acid. The oil which is not
dissolved, can be acted upon again by alcohol; by this second
operation, it yields some parts to the alcohol, and the remainder
loses all its specific qualities. The action of alcohol upon oil
in successive operation, can be followed up to its last limits.</p>

<p>Twenty volumes of oil mixed with 100 volumes of alcohol,
will be followed by the reduction of five volumes of oil. In
the next operation, when the alcohol is renewed, the volume of
the columns of oil lowers only three volumes instead of five.
By a fourth operation, the oil loses not a single volume. When
reduced to this state, the croton oil is slightly amber-colored,
without smell, taste, or acidity; it can be taken in the mouth
without causing any sensation. It is soluble in all proportions
in ether. Its specific gravity is, 92 compared with that of
water. <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span></p>

<p>Thus we find by experiments an evident proof of the co-existence
of a sweet oil with the pungent croton oil.</p>

<p>All the specific properties of the croton oil are carried over
in that dissolved by alcohol.</p>

<p>Is it possible by further processes to separate these active
principles from the oily matter that contains them?</p>

<p>To solve this question we resorted to the following experiment:―</p>

<p>We took two kilogrammes of croton oil, and for several
days we left it in contact with half a kilogramme of alcohol.
A distinct separation took place. The upper part, composed
of oil and alcohol, did not represent the exact quantity employed;
which is explained by the power which the oil has to
dissolve 10 per cent. of alcohol. The upper part being decanted,
it was necessary to remove the alcohol, to avoid the inconvenience
which might have arisen by employing heat for
this purpose. Water was added to this liquid, which having
become turbid, ether was added. Thus the oil came with the
ether to the surface. The ether was removed by free evaporation.
During this lengthened process, the effluvia was so pungent
as to affect the eyes and nostrils of the operator, and cause
blisters to rise on his face. The oil thus obtained is dark-brown,
opaque, thick, possessed of a strong smell and acidity. Applied
to the skin, it causes almost instantaneous pain, followed
by a blister. It is soluble in all proportions in alcohol and
ether. Mixed with nine parts of its volume of olive oil, it
forms a liquid possessing specific qualities stronger than those
of common croton oil.</p>

<p>These facts prove the mobility of the active principles of
croton oil, and the possibility of succeeding in obtaining them
free from all fatty matter by chemical ingenuity, a task which
will be the object of further experiments.</p>

<p>The results from the above experiments are the following:―</p>

<p>1. That the croton oil does not contain a volatile acid.</p>

<p>2. That the sensible acid in croton oil is fixed or retained in
the oil, and cannot be separated from it by a heat at 212° Fahr.,
or even by distillation. <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span></p>

<p>3. That the acrid volatile principle, which exists in this oil,
possesses not the qualities of an acid, and has hitherto withstood
the chemical operations which were instituted to extract it.</p>

<p>4. That the active principles of croton oil are capable of being
separated from one part of the oil, and concentrated in the
other.</p>

<p>5. That croton oil is not homogeneous in its composition, but
is formed of two parts, one inert, of which alcohol is unable to
dissolve more than one-tenth, and a more soluble part, which
carries with it all the active principles.</p>

<p>6. That the greatest degree of concentration of the active
principles, is by acting upon a large quantity of oil with a small
quantity of alcohol.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>7. That either may be usefully employed in manufacturing
croton oil.—<i>Repertoire de Pharmacie.</i>—<i>From the Annals

<h3>ON ALOINE, THE CRYSTALLINE CATHARTIC
PRINCIPLE OF BARBADOES ALOES.
<span class="hsmall">
BY JOHN STENHOUSE, L.L.D., F.R.S.L., &amp; E.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>About two months ago I received from my friend, Mr.
Thomas Smith, apothecary, Edinburgh, a quantity of a brownish
yellow crystalline substance which he had obtained from
Barbadoes aloes. Mr. Smith’s process consisted in pounding
the previously dried aloes with a quantity of sand, so as to prevent
its agglutinating, macerating the mass repeatedly with
cold water, and then concentrating the liquors <i>in vacuo</i> to the
consistence of a syrup. On remaining at rest in a cool place
for two or three days, the concentrated extract became filled
with a mass of small granular crystals of
a brownish yellow <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
color. This is the crude substance to which Mr. Smith has
given the name of Aloine, and which appears to constitute the
cathartic principle of aloes. The brownish yellow crystals obtained
in this way are contaminated with a greenish brown
substance, which changes to brownish black on exposure to the
air, and still more rapidly when it is boiled. In order to purify
the crystals of aloine, therefore, they must first be dried by
pressure between folds of blotting-paper, and then repeatedly
crystallized out of hot water till they have only a pale sulphur
yellow color. The aqueous solutions of aloine must on no
account be boiled, but simply heated to about 150° F., as at
212° F. aloine is rapidly oxidized and decomposed. By dissolving
the purified crystals of aloine in hot spirits of wine,
they are deposited, on the cooling of the solution, in small prismatic
needles arranged in stars. When these crystals have a
pale yellow color, which does not change when they are dried
in the air they may be regarded as pure aloine.</p>

<p>Aloine is quite neutral to test-paper. Its taste is at first
sweetish, but soon becomes intensely bitter. Aloine is not very
soluble either in cold water or in cold spirits of wine; but if the
water or the spirits of wine are even slightly warmed, the solubility
of the aloine is exceedingly increased: the color of these
solutions is pale yellow. Aloine is also very readily dissolved
by the carbonated and caustic fixed alkalies in the cold, forming
a deep orange yellow solution, which rapidly grows darker,
owing to the oxidation which ensues. The effects of ammonia
and its carbonate are precisely similar. When aloine is boiled
either with alkalies or strong acids, it is rapidly changed into
dark brown resins. A solution of bleaching powder likewise
gives aloine a deep orange color, which soon changes to dark
brown. Aloine produces no precipitate in solutions either of
corrosive sublimate, nitrate of silver, or neutral acetate of lead.
It also yields no precipitate with a dilute solution of subacetate
of lead; but in a concentrated solution it throws down a deep
yellow precipitate, which is pretty soluble in cold water, and is
therefore difficult to wash. This precipitate is
by no means <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
very stable; and when it is exposed even for a short time to
the air, it becomes brown.</p>

<p>When powdered aloine is thrown, in small quantities at a
time, into cold fuming nitric acid, it dissolves without evolving
any nitrous fumes, and forms a brownish-red solution. On
adding a large quantity of sulphuric acid, a yellow precipitate
falls, which, when it is washed with water to remove all adhering
acid and then dried, explodes when it is heated. It
plainly, therefore, contains combined nitric acid. I could not,
however, succeed in obtaining this compound in a crystalline
state, as when it was dissolved in spirits, it appeared to be
decomposed. When aloine is digested for some time with
strong nitric acid, much nitrous gas is evolved, and it is converted
into chrysammic acid, but without the formation of any
nitro-picric acid, as is always the case when crude aloes is subjected
to a similar treatment. A quantity of aloine was boiled
with a mixture of chlorate of potash and muriatic acid. The
acid solution was evaporated to dryness, and digested with
strong spirits of wine. The greater portion of the spirits was
removed by distillation; and the remainder, when left to spontaneous
evaporation; yielded a syrup which could not be made
to crystallize. Not a trace of chloranil was produced.</p>

<p>When aloine is destructively distilled, it yields a volatile oil
of a somewhat aromatic odor, and also a good deal of resinous
matter. When aloine is heated on platinum foil it melts, and
then catches fire, burning with a bright yellow flame, and
emitting much smoke. It leaves a somewhat difficultly combustible
charcoal, which, when strongly heated, entirely disappears,
not a trace of ashes being left.</p>

<p>A quantity of aloine dried <i>in vacuo</i> was analyzed with chromate
of lead in the usual way.</p>

<p>I. 0.2615 grm. aloine gave 0.5695 carbonic acid and 0.14
water.</p>

<p>II. 0.2415 grm. aloine gave 0.5250 carbonic acid and 0.126
water. <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span></p>

<p>The aloine employed in these analyses was prepared at three
different times. These results give C<sub>34</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>18</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>14</sub> as the formula
of anhydrous aloine, that dried <i>in vacuo</i> being a hydrate with
one equivalent of water.</p>

<p>When the aloine was allowed to remain in the water-bath for
more than six hours, it continued slowly to lose weight, apparently
owing to its undergoing partial decomposition by the
formation of a brownish resin. The loss of weight gradually
continued for a week or more, but became very rapid when the
aloine was heated to 302° F., when it melted, forming a dark
brownish mass, which when cooled became as
hard and brittle <span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
as colophonium. It still, however, contained a good deal of
unaltered aloine, as I ascertained by crystallizing it out with
hot spirits and analyzing it. Much of the aloine, however, had
been changed, most probably by oxidation, into a dark brown
un­cry­stal­li­za­ble resin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B<b>ROM-ALOINE.</b></span>—When an excess of bromine is poured into a
cold aqueous solution of aloine, a bright yellow precipitate is
immediately produced, the amount of which increases on
standing, while at the same time the supernatant liquid becomes
very acid from containing free hydrobromic acid. The precipitate,
after it has been washed with cold water to remove adhering
acid, is dissolved in hot spirits of wine; and on the cooling
of the solution it is deposited in bright yellow needles
radiating from centres, which attach themselves to the bottom
and sides of the containing vessel.</p>

<p>The crystals of brom-aloine are considerably broader than
those of aloine, and have a richer yellow color and a higher
lustre. Brom-aloine is quite neutral to test-paper, is not so soluble
in either cold water or cold spirits of wine as aloine, but
dissolves very readily in hot spirits of wine.</p>

<p>The brom-aloine employed in these analyses was prepared at
two different times. It is plain therefore
from these results, <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
that this bromine compound is aloine, C<sub>34</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>18</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>14</sub> in which 3
equivs. of hydrogen are replaced by 3 equivs. of bromine.—The
formula of brom-aloine therefore is C<sub>34</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>15</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>14</sub>&#x202f;Br<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>When a stream of chlorine gas was sent for a considerable
time through a cold aqueous solution of aloine, a deep yellow
precipitate was produced. It contained a great deal of combined
chlorine; but as it could not be made to crystallize, it
was not subjected to analysis. In the present instance, and in
those of several other feeble organic principles, such as orcine,
chlorine appears to act some what too strongly, so that the constitution
of the substance is destroyed, and merely un­cry­stal­li­za­ble
resins are produced. Bromine, on the other hand, is much
more gentle in its operations, and usually simply replaces a
moderate amount of the hydrogen in the substance, so that, as
in the case of orcine and aloine, crystalline compounds are produced.</p>

<p>It has long been known to medical practitioners, that the
aqueous extract of aloes is by far the most active preparation
of that drug. The reason of this is now very plain, as the concentrated
extract of aloes obtained by exhausting aloes with
cold water consists chiefly of aloine, by much the larger portion
of the resin being left undissolved. Mr. Smith informs me, that
from a series of pretty extensive trials, from 2 to 4 grs. of aloine
have been found more effective than from 10 to 15 grs. of ordinary
aloes. Aloine is, I should think, therefore, likely ere long, to
supersede, at least to a considerable extent, the ad­min­i­stra­tion
of crude aloes.</p>

<p>I endeavored to obtain aloine by operating on considerable
quantities of Barbadoes, Cape and Socotrine aloes. These were
macerated in cold water, and the aqueous solutions obtained were
concentrated to the state of thin extracts on the water-bath. I
was quite unsuccessful in every instance. The impurities contained
in the extracts in these different kinds of aloes appear,
when in contact with the oxygen of the air, to act upon the
aloine so as effectually to prevent it from crystallizing. Aloine
can only, therefore, be obtained in a crystalline
state by <span class="xxpn" id="p183">{183}</span>
concentrating the cold aqueous solution of aloes <i>in vacuo</i>; though,
after the aloine has once been crystallized, and it is freed from
the presence of those impurities which appear to act so injuriously
upon it, the aloine may be quite readily crystallized out
of its aqueous solutions in the open air.</p>

<p>Though aloine has as yet only been obtained from Barbadoes
aloes, I have scarcely any doubt that it also exists both in Cape
and Socotrine aloes. The amount of aloine in Cape aloes, is,
however, in all probability, much smaller than in either of the
other two species; for Cape aloes is well known to be a much
feebler cathartic, and to contain a mass of impurities. In corroboration
of this opinion, I would refer to the fact already
mentioned in a previous part of this paper, viz. that when aloine
is digested with nitric acid, it is converted into Dr. Schunck’s
chrysammic acid. Now it has been satisfactorily ascertained
that all the three species of aloes yield chrysammic acid, of
which in fact they are the only known sources. Cape aloes, as
might have been expected, yields by far the smallest amount
of chrysammic acid together with much oxalic and some nitro-picric
acids. There appears, therefore, great reason to believe
that all the three kinds of aloes contain aloine.</p>

<p>Since the above was written, I have learned from Mr. Smith
that he has not succeeded in obtaining crystallized aloine from
either Cape or Socotrine aloes. Mr. Smith does not doubt that
both of these species of aloes also contain aloine, though, most
probably contaminated with so much resin, or some other substances,
as prevents it from crystallizing. What tends to
confirm Mr. Smith in this opinion is the observation he has
made, that when the crude crystals of aloine are allowed to
remain in contact with the mother liquor of the Barbadoes
aloes, they disappear and become un­cry­stal­li­za­ble. I have also
observed a similar occurrence in the mother-liquors of tolerably
pure aloine. These become always darker and darker; so that
if we continue to dissolve new quantities of aloine in them, at
length scarcely any of it crystallizes out, and the whole becomes
changed into
a dark-colored magma. <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span></p>

<p>In the year 1846, M. E. Robiquet published an account of
an examination he had made of Socotrine aloes. By treating
the concentrated aqueous solution of this species of aloes with
basic acetate of lead, he obtained a brownish yellow precipitate,
which was collected on a filter and washed with hot water.
On decomposing this lead compound with sulphuretted hydrogen
and evaporating the solution to dryness, he obtained an
almost colorless varnish, consisting of a scaly mass, which was
not in the least degree crystalline. M. E. Robiquet subjected
his substance, which he called aloetine, to analysis, and obtained
the following result:―</p>

<p>It is plain, therefore, that M. E. Robiquet’s aloetine, if it
really is a definite organic principle, which I very much
question, is certainly a very different substance from the aloine
which has formed the subject of the present notice.—<i>London

<h3>ON HENRY’S MAGNESIA.
<span class="hsmall">
BY DR. MOHR.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In England, under this name is sold a calcined magnesia, at
a very high price, which is not to be obtained in any other way.
Many English travelers, as well as most of their countrymen,
believe that they possess a very large knowledge of medicines,
because such things as blue pills, calomel, sweet spirits of nitre,
and laudanum they administer without
medical advice, and <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
bring this magnesia with them to our shops when they wish a
recipe to be dispensed, which contains calcined magnesia as
one of the ingredients. By such opportunities, I became acquainted
with the purity and beauty of this preparation, and
its peculiar silky gloss and whiteness. With a view to discover
its method of preparation, I made the following research:―</p>

<p>By heating to redness the ordinary carbonate of magnesia, it
is not to be obtained. The ordinary magnesia of commerce,
which produces by a red heat a fine calcined magnesia, I exposed
in a crucible, to a strong white heat. It solidified, and
was of a yellow color, and had become so hard that it was only
with the greatest labor that it could be powdered and sifted.
Prepared in this way, it cannot be used. I now prepared some
carbonate of magnesia, observing that Henry’s was very dense,
without reference to that result, which was very fine, by precipitation
in the heat. The process by which the flocculent
magnesia of commerce is obtained, is not explained in any
chemical works. Pure sulphate of magnesia, free from iron,
was dissolved in distilled water, and a solution of carbonate of
soda added to it as long as anything was precipitated by a boiling
heat. The ebullition was continued until the mixture ceased
to evolve carbonic acid, and set aside for decantation. When
decanted, fresh distilled water was added to the precipitate,
and the whole again boiled, and afterwards placed on a filter
and washed with hot distilled water, until the liquid passing
from the filter gave no trace of sulphuric acid. The precipitate,
when pressed and dried, was very white and dense. It
was exposed to an intense white heat in a closely-covered Hessian
crucible for one hour. When the crucible was opened, I
found a beautifully white magnesia, finely granulated. Where
it had come in contact with the crucible, it had acquired a
yellow color, from the peroxide of iron contained in the crucible.
The yellow portion alone adhered firmly to the crucible
and the rest was perfectly white, and readily removed. In
acids, this magnesia was with difficulty dissolved, although ultimately
completely soluble therein. By a
repetition of this <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
process, an identical result was obtained. The magnesia thus
produced in small lumps exhibited by transmitted light a slight
rosy tint, and by reflected light, a very white color. In these
respects, it agrees perfectly with Henry’s. To determine its
comparative density, a cubic inch measure was filled with its
powder, and weighed. As the results of three trials, it contained
respectively 10,74, 11,19, and 11,18 grammes of the powder.
Two experiments with Henry’s magnesia gave 7, and 7,2
grammes. Three of the carbonate of magnesia, prepared
by heat, gave 12,68, 12,9, and 12,5 grm. One of the ordinary
calcined magnesia gave 1,985 grm.; and one of the ordinary
carbonate of magnesia, 1,4 grm.</p>

<p>The calcined magnesia, as above prepared, contains some
hard particles, which are very difficult to pulverize. In attempting
to powder them, I remarked that this magnesia, which
was washed before being burnt until no traces of sulphuric acid
could be detected, now afforded an evidence of a small portion
still being present. This same observation I have previously
made in the preparation of oxide of zinc. To remove this contamination,
I recommend that carbonate of magnesia should
first be lightly burnt, and then well washed with hot water, and
again burnt with a very strong heat.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The above determinations of the density of the magnesias
must not be confounded with their specific gravity. To ascertain
the latter is a task of great difficulty, for Rose, in attempting
it, obtained such discrepant results, that he has withheld
them. The specific gravity of Henry’s magnesia, as near as it
could be ascertained, is from 2,50 to 2,67. The magnesia prepared
according to my process, gave 3,148 as its specific
weight.—<i>Buchner’s Repertorium, in Annals of Pharmacy.</i></p>

<h3>MEDICINE AND PHARMACY IN BRAZIL.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In the entire Brazilian empire, there are two national faculties
of medicine, termed <i>Escola Imperial de Medecina</i>, one
established at Rio de Janeiro, the other
at Bahia—the present <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
and former capitals of Brazil. Both are constituted exactly
alike in laws, forms, number of professors, modelled, with very
trifling difference, after the constitution of the <i>Ecole de Médecine</i>
of Paris. Each college consists of fourteen professors, and
six substitute professors, with a director and a vice-director,
answering to our own dean and vice-dean of the faculty. The
latter are named by Government, from a triple list sent up by
the professors every third year, and discharge the ordinary duties
of their chairs, being only exempt from attending the examinations.
They possess a limited controling power over
their college, and constitute the official channel of communication
with Government and public bodies, on all matters relating
to public health, prisons, &amp;c. The duties of professor-substitute
are explained in the name. When illness, or public
employment—the latter not unusual in Brazil—interferes with
the duties of the professor, his chair is supplied by the substitute:
both are appointed, as in France, by <i>concours</i>. Most of
the older members have graduated in Portugal, Scotland,
France, or Italy. Both classes receive a fixed income from the
State, and derive no emolument whatever from pupils and examination
fees, &amp;c. which are applied to public purposes connected
with the college. The income of the professor was fixed
at twelve hundred <i>mil-reis</i> per annum—(about three hundred
pounds) when first established; and that of the professor-substitute
at eight hundred <i>mil-reis</i>. Both enjoy the right of retirement
on their full salary, after twenty years’ service, or when
incapacitated by age or infirmities. A travelling professor is
elected by <i>concours</i> by the faculty, every four years, for the
purpose of investigating, in the different countries of Europe,
the latest improvements and discoveries in medicine and the
collateral sciences, an account of which he regularly transmits,
in formal reports, to his college. His expenses are defrayed by
the State.</p>

<p>The medical faculty consists of the following chairs:—1,
physics; 2, botany; 3, chemistry; 4, anatomy; 5, physiology;
6, external pathology; 7, internal pathology;
8, materia <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span>
medica; 9, hygiene; 10, operations; 12, midwifery; 13, clinical
medicine; 14, clinical surgery.</p>

<p>In addition to the professors, there is a secretary (medical),
treasurer, librarian, and chemical assistant—all elected by the
faculty.</p>

<p>The order of study is as follows:—first year, medical physics
and medical botany; second year, chemistry and general and
descriptive anatomy; third year, anatomy and physiology;
fourth year, external pathology, internal pathology, pharmacy
and materia medica; fifth year, operative medicine and midwifery;
sixth year, hygiene, history of medicine, and legal
medicine.</p>

<p>All examinations are public, and the subjects are drawn by
lot.</p>

<p>The titles conferred by the faculty, are only three, viz., Doctor
in Medicine, Apothecary, and Midwife. The latter is specially
educated and examined.</p>

<p>In each chief city there are commonly three or four large
hospitals—the Misericordia, or Civil Hospital, possessed of
ample funds from endowments, legacies, and certain taxes; the
Military and Naval Hopitals; and in Rio, Bahia, and Pernambuco,
Leper Hospitals. There are also infirmaries attached to
convents. Private subscriptions to institutions are utterly
unknown.</p>

<p>The academical session lasts for eight months—from 1st
March to 30th October—lectures being delivered daily (with
some exceptions) by the professors or their substitutes. The
professors of clinical medicine and surgery have the right of
selecting their cases from the Misericordia Hospital.</p>

<p>The student, previous to matriculation, must take his degree
in arts; and the curiculum is the same for all, viz., six years
to obtain the degree of Doctor in Medicine. The examinations
are conducted as in Paris. For the degree of Doctor in Surgery—which,
however, is not essential—a subsequent and special
examination must be undergone, as in France.</p>

<p>All students are classified, on entering
college, into <i>medical</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
and <i>phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal</i>; and both are obliged to obtain the degree
in arts before they can be matriculated, and to have completed
their sixteenth year. The phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal student obtains his
diploma of pharmacy after three years study; while that of
medicine can only be obtained after six years. The student of
pharmacy is obliged to repeat the courses of medical physics,
botany, chemistry, pharmacy and materia medica; while one
course only of each is required from the medical pupil. The
phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal student is obliged to attend for three years in
a pharmacy, after the conclusion of his academical studies. He
then undergoes an examination by the faculty, and publicly
defends a thesis to obtain his diploma. His duty afterwards,
as apothecary, is strictly limited to the sale of drugs, and the
compounding of prescriptions. He is never consulted professionally;
and, did he attempt to apply a remedy for the cure
of any disease, he would be immediately fined fifty <i>mil-reis</i> by
the municipality, for the first, and an increasing fine for every
subsequent offence; and, did he still persist, his licence would

<h3>CHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF BROOM.
<span class="hsmall">
(CYTISUS SCOPARIUS D. C.)</span>
<span class="hsmall">
BY DR. STENHOUSE.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The broom plants examined by Dr. Stenhouse, had an uncommonly
bitter taste. The watery decoction, evaporated
down to a tenth part, leaves a gelatinous residue, which consists
chiefly of scoparin. This is a yellow colored substance, which,
when purified, can be got in stellate crystals, and is easily soluble
in boiling water and spirit of wine. Dr. Stenhouse, from
five ultimate analyses, assigns it to the
constitution C<sub>21</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>11</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>10</sub>.</p>

<p>Scoparin is, according to an extensive series of experiments
by Dr. Stenhouse, the diuretic principle of broom, which has
been recognised by Mead, Cullen, Pearson,
Pereira, and others, <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
as one of the most efficacious remedies in dropsy. The dose
for an adult is 5 or 6 grains. Its diuretic action begins in 12
hours, and the urine under its use is more than doubled in
quantity.</p>

<p>From the mother liquor of the crude scoparin, Dr. S. obtained,
by distillation, a colorless oily liquid, which, when purified,
was found to be a new volatile organic base spartein. This
has a peculiarly bitter taste, and possesses powerful narcotic
properties. A single drop dissolved by means of acetic acid,
affected a rabbit so much, that it lay stupified for 5 or 6 hours.
Another rabbit, which took four grains, first went into a state
of violent excitement, then fell into sopor and died in three
hours. The author observes that shepherds have long been acquainted
with the excitant and narcotic action of broom.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The proportion of Scoparin and spartein, varies very much
in plants grown in different localities, which probably explains
the very different accounts given by practitioners of its activity
as a drug. The author suggests that it would be better to employ
pure scoparin free from admixture of spartein.—<i>Edin.

<span class="smmaj">BY</span>
<span class="smcap">T<b>INCTURE</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">A<b>CONITE.</b></span></h4>—The frequent use of the strong tincture
of aconite root, as an external application, has, as might have been expected, given
rise to repeated accidents, from the accidental or careless internal ad­min­i­stra­tion
of that powerful substance in an overdose. An instance has occurred within a
day or two, where an attendant administered a tea-spoonful of the tincture, which
had been directed to be used as a liniment for a rheumatic affection. An emetic
of sulphate of zinc was administered by the physician, and within five minutes
after the poison had been swallowed, free vomiting was produced. This continued
for several hours, though the external application of
mustard poultices to <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
the pit of the stomach, and the ad­min­i­stra­tion of strong coffee, with small doses
of laudanum, were employed to check it. The man was naturally very stupid,
and could give no clear account of his sensations. He made no complaint of his
throat, until his attention was directed to it, when he said it was sore and that
he had difficulty in swallowing. He had a strange, as he termed it, bursting
sensation in his limbs, with constant sickness and retching, and great debility.
He looked alarmed and anxious, and was restless. The pupils were at first
dilated, then nearly natural, and afterwards again dilated. The extremities
were cold and moist, the pulse early intermitting and weak, became extinct at
the wrist, and the action of the heart was feeble and irregular. Stimulants
were administered internally, but could not be retained, brandy and water
with carbonate of ammonia was afterwards given in injections, per anum. and the
temperature of the extremities maintained by mustard poultices, and the application
of heat. After an interval of seven or eight hours the pulse again became
perceptible, and the man gradually recovered.</div>

<p>The char­ac­ter­is­tic symptoms produced by poisoning with aconite, are a peculiar
numb tingling sensation produced in the tongue and lips, a sensation in
the throat, as if the palate were enlarged and elongated, and resting upon the
root of the tongue, irritability of the stomach, a numb creeping or tingling sensation
felt in the limbs, or over the whole surface, and depressed action of
the heart, and consequent prostration and coldness of the extremities. Death
when it occurs, seems to depend on the depressing effect produced upon the
heart. From this it would seem that the proper treatment would be, 1st, to promote
the evacuation of the poison by mild means. 2nd, to maintain the circulation,
by keeping the patient as quiet as possible in a horizontal posture, by the
application of sinapisms and external warmth to the extremities, and by the
ad­min­i­stra­tion of stimulants by the mouth or when they cannot be retained, by
the rectum, and 3d, to control, if possible, the vomiting.</p>

<p>Pereira states that aconite, when dropped in the eye, or when taken internally
in poisonous doses, produces contraction of the pupils, and that with the exception
of opium, it is the only article which does so. In the above case, and in one
other, which was likewise seen by the writer, the pupils were dilated, and the
same condition was observed in several cases which have been communicated to
him.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The above case is note-worthy from the great severity of the symptoms endangering
the patients life, which followed the ad­min­i­stra­tion of a single tea-spoonful of
the poison. It must have been absorbed too, with great promptness, since the vomiting,
which took place in five minutes afforded no relief. This probably depended
on the stomach being empty at the time. Much of the difference observed in
the effects produced by the same dose, too, doubtless depends on the variation of
the strength of the tincture, caused either by the employment of different formulæ
in its preparation, or by the occasional use of decayed and inferior roots in
making it.</p>

officinal in the lately revised U. S. Pharmacopœia, appearing
to me to afford rather an ethereal oil, than what may be properly
called a fluid extract, I am induced to make known the
process which I have been accustomed to adopt, during some
years, to obtain what I conceive to be a true extract, containing,
in an agreeably administrable form, all and the whole of
the properties belonging to the berry, and which has given
much satisfaction in practice, particularly to patients, some of
whom who have had extensive experience in the use of anti-gonnorrhæl

<p>The coarsely powdered cubebs, being lightly packed in a
displacement funnel, I pour upon it as much of a mixture of
equal parts of ether and spirit of wine, as it will imbibe, and,
having covered closely the top of the apparatus with moistened
bladder, and corked the lower aperture, allow it to stand for
twenty-four hours. I then uncork it, and after
it has ceased <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
dropping, displace the remainder with Sp. Vin. Rect. until
the original quantity (generally a pint,) be obtained; this I set
aside in an open and shallow vessel to <i>evaporate spontaneously</i>,
until all the ether, and most of the spirit has passed off, reducing
the quantity to about one half. I then obtain, by displacement
with diluted alcohol, another pint of the liquid, exposing
it in the same manner, until three-fourths of the quantity
is evaporated spontaneously as before; again another pint is
obtained by displacement with water, (this will be a proof
spirit tincture,) which is added to the former, and allowed to
lose by the same means, about one-fourth, or sufficient to leave
a resulting quantity of one and a half pints, which will contain
about eight ounces of alcohol. The displacement with water is
continued to exhaustion, when enough fluid will be obtained to
raise the quantity, when added to that already prepared, to
two and a half pints, which is transferred to a proper bottle,
and there is dissolved in it sixteen ounces of white sugar, yielding,
in toto, three pints of fluid extract, equal to one pound
of the berries, one

powder. The dregs, when dried, are destitute of sensible properties,
appearing to be merely ligneous remains, and the loss
in weight, when time is had, may be easily calculated and
compared with the recorded analyses. The extract has the appearance
of a somewhat thick, brownish colored liquid, possessing
the peculiar taste and smell of the cubebs in a remarkable
degree, remaining homogeneous for some time after agitation,
and showing after settling a large proportion of the
oleaginous constituents of the berry. Having aimed more at
efficiency than beauty in this preparation, I claim for it the
former rather than the latter, and if it should not invite the
eye, it will be found very agreeable to the palate. Fluid extract
of valerian may be prepared by the same process, and,
indeed, all those of a volatile nature, whose active principles
are soluble in any of the above menstrua.</p>

remedied by using <i>only one half the quantity</i> of Aq.

“Cold Cream,” which is given to it by the fair sex, for whose

irritating fancy article of the same name. It is also an admirable
unirritating, cooling, dressing for surgical use; but I would
remark, <i>en passant</i>, that it is a very unfit medium for the composition
of ointments, for which purpose it is sometimes prescribed
to the annoyance of the apothecary. In such cases the
physician should be apprised that the addition of a drop of oil of

to union is readily overcome by the addition of ten drops

unnecessary to state that this difficulty will not be had when
the balsam is adulterated with alcohol—a good practical test of

phar­ma­ceu­tists of the day, savoring much more strongly
of “Quackery,” to use a vulgar phrase, than Art Unions, &amp;c.
are pronounced by legal wisdom to do of the “Lottery.” I allude,
for example, to the system of <i>getting up</i>, under some
mystified appellation, certain preparations, as “Brown’s Elixir,”
“White’s Essence,” or
“Black’s Compound,”—something or <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
other, which are merely the ordinary preparations of the shop,
or could easily be prepared if they were worth the trouble, but
under <i>assumed names</i>, are heralded forth at the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal perfectibility. I do not envy a reputation
so acquired, nor do I wish to speak of it in that spirit, but to
point out its inconsistency with correct principles, and designate
it as unworthy of honorable ambition. Such preparations
generally “hail” from some obscure place or person, but are
occasionally dabbled with by others who should give themselves
to better things. It is self evident, from the nature of
his calling, that the exclusive duty of the apothecary <i>per se</i>, is
to make, as faithfully or skilfully as he may, the various preparations
of the Pharmacopœia, as therein set down, when he is
called upon to do so, and to compound accurately the prescriptions
of the physician. If, by long experience or increased skill,
he may have been led to any real discovery or improvement,
the minutiæ of which he does not choose to divulge, (the reverse
of which would be the more generous,) its nature should be
stated, when relating to a preparation, in terms distinct enough
at least, to convey an idea of its real composition and medical
properties: thus tinctures should not be misnamed Essences or
Extracts; Fluid Extracts, or Concentrated Infusions, Elixirs;
Syrups, Panaceas, &amp;c. thus avoiding the inconsistency of condemning,
if not morally, at least <i>constitutionally</i>, the more open
mountebank who plunders your pockets, while the beam is in
your own eye. It is also perhaps worthy of remark that the
necessity does not appear any longer to exist of retaining those
prescriptively excellent preparations made by some, no doubt,
very respectable apothecary in London, claiming, with a dozen
others, to be the sole possessor of the original receipt. They
are imported at a very high price, and as the composition of
most, perhaps all, is, or can be known, might be made by any
apothecary here as well as in London. Some of them might be
deserving of adoption into the Pharmacopœia, as have been
Dover’s Powder, Daffy’s Elixir, &amp;c. already. It is said by
connoisseurs in wines, that madeira is very
much improved by <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
crossing the line; but I am not aware that phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal preparations
are at all benefitted by crossing the ocean. Their
<i>genuineness</i>, too, has become a by-word. By the way, I was
gravely informed by a certain importer, the other day, of whom
I enquired concerning one of these <i>genuine</i> articles, that it was
obtained directly from the inventor. I was at a loss to imagine
the “modus transitûs,” nor had I the hardihood to enquire, the
good man having been gathered to his fathers scores of years
ago.</div>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Various are the unworthy practices, one or two of which are
thus curtly alluded to, deserving of a more studied notice and
severe censure, than I am able or willing to give them. Such
matters, though not exactly “putting money in the purse,”
should be attended to. The purging of our profession—for it is
one—of them, would be a highly meritorious service.</p>

<h3>CHLORIC ETHER.
<span class="hsmall">
BY J. F. HOLTON, PROFESSOR OF BOTANY IN THE NEW YORK
COLLEGE OF PHARMACY.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In the early part of this century, some chemists in Holland
found a peculiar oily fluid of very fragrant smell, resulted from
the action of chlorine on Olefiant gas. It is generally known
as the Dutch liquid; it has been called also chloric ether and
bichloric ether. Its composition is
C<sub>4</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>In 1831, Mr. Samuel Guthrie of Sackets Harbor, in this
State, distilled alcohol from the so called chloride of lime, and
obtained a product so closely resembling the Dutch liquid that
he though it identical. From some relations to formic acid, it
was afterwards called Chloroform, and chloroformid. Its composition
is C<sub>4</sub>&#x202f;HO<sub>3</sub>. In 1847,
anaésthetic properties brought <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
chloroform prominently before the public. We find an article
by Prof. B. Silliman, Jr., in the American Journal of Science,
new series, vol., 5, p. 240, in which it is stated that “the terms
chloric ether, bichloric ether, perchloride of formyle, Dutch oil
and oil of Dutch chemists, are all synonyms of chloroform.”</p>

<p>In a recent visit of the writer at New Haven he saw a prescription
of “chloric ether.” Being reminded of the singular
error in the Journal printed there, he inquired into the nature
of the article dispensed. It proved to be a solution of chloroform
in alcohol, and on his return to this city he found the
same practice here to a small extent. The proportions in the
article bearing this name vary greatly; often it seems that the
mere contents of the wash-bottle are in this way disposed of,
containing of course a large proportion of water. Mr. Currie,
one of our most careful and consciencious chemists, usually
prepares it so as to contain 10 per cent. in bulk of chloroform.
A more convenient formula would be, chloroform 1 part, alcohol
10 parts. Some such article under the name of Tinctura
Chloroformi ought to have place in our pharmacopœia.</p>

<p>But to our confusion the term chloric ether is applied to yet
another, and entirely a different body, formed by the distillation
of alcohol and hydrochloric acid, the composition of which is
C<sub>4</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>5</sub>&#x202f;O. This is also called
hydrochloric ether and muriatic ether.</p>

<p>But to neither of these four substances does the name chloric
ether properly belong. Were there such a thing, it would
be obtained from the action of chloric acid on alcohol, a reaction
which is prevented by the decomposition of the chloric
acid by the alcohol, to which it gives part of its oxygen, forming
acetic acid.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>This subject is not of so much importance intrinsically as it is
by way of illustrating the extreme importance of rigid adhesion to
systematic nomenclature as the only means of saving us from dangerous
errors and inextricable confusion.</p>

<h3>ON THE PREPARATION OF PURE MAGNESIA.
<span class="hsmall">
BY HENRY WURTZ, M. A.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The preparation of few substances presents such difficulties
as that of <i>Pure Magnesia</i>.</p>

<p>It seems, however, at first glance, that the cheapness and
general purity of the sulphate which occurs in commerce, would
render this an easy task. Unfortunately, however, no simple
process has yet been proposed for obtaining pure magnesia from
the sulphate. The usual course is to precipitate from the boiling
solution with carbonate of soda, and to expel the carbonic
acid from the magnesia alba thus obtained, by ignition. On
trying this process, however, it was found that the carbonate of
magnesia thus precipitated could not be freed from soda by washing.
After an enormous quantity of hot distilled water had
passed through it on the filter, the slight residue left by evaporation
of the washings, still gave the soda tinge to flame.</p>

<p>It is true that the trace of the soda compound thus retained
might probably be washed out of the magnesia after its ignition,
but the difficulty and tedium of the operation of washing the
very voluminous precipitate, together with the expense attendant
upon the necessity of using <i>pure</i> carbonate of soda, to
avoid the presence of silica, phosphoric acid, and other impurities,
which, if present, would inevitably contaminate the magnesia,
induced me to reject this method. In fact this method,
which was formerly almost used universally by analysts for the
<i>determination</i> of magnesia is now rejected by them, except
in some unavoidable cases.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn16" id="fnanch16">16</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch16" id="fn16">16</a>
<i>H. Ross’s Handbuch</i>, last
edition, 2, 33.</p></div>

<p>The substitution of carbonate of ammonia for carbonate of soda
is inadmissible with any regard to economy, on account of the
existence of the soluble double sulphates of ammonia and magnesia.
A trial was made to decompose sulphate of magnesia
by mixing its anhydrous powder with a large quantity of carbonate
of ammonia, and igniting, but the
only trace of <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
decomposition which appeared was a slight alkaline re-action of the
aqueous solution of the mass.</p>

<p>I must here mention an impurity which I have met with in
commercial sulphate of magnesia, and this is a double sulphate
of magnesia and potash, which occurs in small crystals, apparently
rhombohedrons, among the rectangular prisms of the
Epsom salt. It may probably be separable by re­crys­tal­li­za­tion,
though this, with sulphate of magnesia, is rather a difficult
affair.</p>

<p>The method which I adopted for preparing pure magnesia
was the ignition of the nitrate prepared from the commercial
<i>magnesia alba</i>. The impurities in the commercial carbonate
which I made use of were sulphate and chloride, a surprisingly
large quantity of silica, a trace of phosphoric acid easily detectable
by molybdate of ammonia, oxide of iron, alumina, lime,
alkalies and some organic matter. A small excess of this impure
article was added to commercial nitric acid and the whole
boiled; the silica, oxide of iron, alumina and phosphoric acid
were thus separated by the excess of magnesia and the filtered
solution contained no trace of either of them; the solution was
slightly colored by organic matter.</p>

<p>Either of two methods may now be adopted for separating
the <i>lime</i>.</p>

<p>One is to add a late excess of ammonia, then a little oxalic
acid, and filter. To this method, besides the expense of so large
a quantity of <i>pure</i> ammonia the necessity of the subsequent decomposition
and expulsion by heat of the very large quantity
of nitrate of ammonia formed is a serious objection.</p>

<p>Unsuccessful attempts were made to separate the lime by
adding oxalic acid immediately to the neutral solution of nitrate
of magnesia. It was found upon experiment that oxalate of lime
is somewhat soluble in a solution of nitrate of magnesia.</p>

<p>The other method, which is preferable, consists in adding to
the solution a little sulphate of magnesia, and then a quantity
of alcohol, but not enough of the latter to produce any immediate
precipitation. If a precipitate
is formed immediately, <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
water is added, for, singularly enough, it was found that the
liquid filtered from this first precipitate still contained lime.
In the course of time the sulphate of lime separates in the form
of small crystals.</p>

<p>The filtered liquid is now evaporated in porcelain dishes, and
the residue transferred to porcelain crucibles, or still better,
to platinum dishes, and the nitric acid expelled by a gentle
heat. By a slight modification I have succeeded in shortening
this operation very much, that is by adding, from time to time,
powdered carbonate of ammonia to the mass, and stirring with
a glass rod, or a platinum spatula. When no more red gases
are evolved the heat is raised to redness for a few minutes.
The mass thus obtained requires washing with pure water to
separate alkaline salts and some sulphate of magnesia which it
still contains.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Magnesia thus prepared was found, by a most rigid qualitative
analysis, to be perfectly pure. I am aware, however, that
the process is a troublesome one, and it is very much to be
desired that some one would present us with a simple and
direct process of obtaining pure magnesia from the sulphate.</p>

<h3>ON TINCTURE OF IPECACUANHA.
<span class="hsmall">
BY G. F. LEROY, OF BRUSSELS.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Officinal preparations during reposition or preservation, when
placed in situations proper to preserve them from all changes,
yet undergo such important modifications, that the pharmaceutist
is frequently obliged to reject them as worthless. We are
accustomed to consider alcoholic tinctures, by reason of the vehicle
used in their preparation, as amongst the most stable of
officinal preparations; and therefore
very few <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
pharmacologists have observed the changes they undergo. Amongst those
whose attention has been drawn to the subject, I may particularly
cite: 1st, Baumé, who has remarked that tincture of saffron
deposits a substance analagous to amber.—(<i>Elements of
Pharmacy</i>, 2d <i>ed.</i> 1789.)</p>

<p>2nd. Guibourt, who presented to the Academy of Medicine
at Paris, some observations on the changes in its composition
which tincture of iodine undergoes according to the time when
it was prepared, (year 1846.)</p>

<p>3rd. Bastick, with the desire of ascertaining the nature of
the changes to which alcoholic preparations are subject, placed
various tinctures, during several months, in situations similar to
those of a pharmacy, that is to say, exposed to a temperature
varying from 60° to 80° Fahrenheit, in bottles half filled, and
to which air was, from time to time, admitted.</p>

<p>On examining them, some time afterwards, he found that
most of them had undergone active fermentation in a greater
or less degree, and that the alcohol had gradually become converted
into acetic acid. The tinctures had generally lost their
color and taste, and contained <i>a precipitate which was partially
re-soluble</i> in a proportion of alcohol corresponding to that
which had been decomposed.—(<i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal and
Transactions</i>, 1848.)</p>

<p>The tinctures prepared with weak alcohol are the most subject
to this species of change.</p>

<p>4th. Tincture of kino changes so with time, that it passes
from the liquid to the gelatinized state. This change even affords
an excellent test when it is suspected that catechu may
have been substituted for kino in this preparation.—(<i>Dorvault,
Officine</i>, 1850, 3d. ed.)</p>

<p>In general, pharmacologists consider that tinctures only deteriorate
by the evaporation of the alcohol used in their preparation,
and that this evaporation has the effect of concentrating
them too much, and of giving rise to the precipitation of a
part of the principles which were held in solution.</p>

<p>I do not entirely concur in this opinion; on
the contrary, I <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
believe that, in many cases, the precipitates which are formed
in the tinctures, do not arise from the evaporation of a part of
the vehicle, but from a modification which takes place in a part
of the principles held in solution, and which, becoming less
soluble, or even insoluble, are precipitated.</p>

<p>Amongst these precipitates I shall place that which is almost
uniformly found in tincture of ipecacuanha.</p>

<p>Druggists generally are aware that this tincture, shortly after
its preparation, throws down a deposite of a yellowish white
color, very light, and increasing daily; that when separated by
filtration a new deposit immediately commences, and recourse
must again be had to filtering.</p>

<p>It is only after three or four filterings, at intervals of five or
six weeks, that the formation of this deposit can be arrested.
In the course of July of this year, I prepared from the <i>Belgian
Pharmacopœia</i>, some tincture of ipecacuanha, to be used in the
preparation of some syrup of the same.</p>

<p>Desiring to follow the different phases which it presents, and
to study, as far as possible, the nature of the precipitate
formed in it, (for as yet I believe that no research has been directed
to this subject.) I took advantage of the opportunity
which this preparation afforded me.</p>

<p>About six weeks after its preparation, this tincture contained
a deposit which was yellowish white, tolerably abundant, very
light, and rising on being shaken.</p>

<p>I again suffered the precipitate to form, and after some days,
I decanted the clear liquor, and threw the deposit on a filter.
I afterwards mixed the decanted liquors and that which was
filtered, in a bottle.</p>

<p>The precipitate remaining on the filter, I repeatedly washed.
I put it to dry spontaneously, but perceiving, after twenty-four
hours, that it was becoming the prey of a number of little cryptogami,
formed in the same manner as in animal gelatine which
dries slowly in the air, I hastened the desication by carrying
the filter into a medium of from 30°
to 35° centigrade. <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span></p>

<p>This deposit, during the process of drying, loses its hydrogen,
changes color, becoming reddish brown, and is slightly translucid,
when very dry it is friable.</p>

<p>The quantity obtained in this first filtering, weighed 5
grains of the Netherland weights, or 0,3250 milligrammes;
from an ounce or 32 grammes of roots, employed towards the
end of October, I again saved the deposit which was formed:
it weighed 1 grain, Netherland, or 0,065 milligrammes.</p>

<p>At present, at the end of November, a third deposition is
taking place, and will be collected to be added to the others.</p>

<p>During the whole time the tincture had no effect either upon
blue or red litmus paper.</p>

<p><i>Physical properties.</i> The precipitate is solid, friable, of a
reddish color, slightly translucent, without taste.</p>

<p><i>Chemical properties.</i> Ether, alcohol, water, cold or boiling,
have no action upon it; dilute hydrochloric, sulphuric and
nitric acids, have no action when cold. Concentrated nitric
acid, when cold, produces no effect upon it, but if heated to
ebullition it attacks it actively, becoming of a brownish red color.
Put in a glass tube closed by one only of its extremities, the
other being furnished with two pieces of litmus paper, the one becomes
blue, the other red. If the tube is placed in the flame of a
spirit lamp, in a few instants the matter swells and the reddened
paper becomes again blue.</p>

<p>Placed on a slip of platina, and exposed to the flame of a
spirit lamp, it swells, giving out a strong odor of burnt animal
matter; it burns without flame and leaves a white ash. This
ash treated by reagents, has the char­ac­ter­is­tics of lime.</p>

<p>As may be seen by this short exposition, the deposit is by no
means a product resulting from the evaporation of a part of the
alcohol, which holds in solution the principles that are deposited,
but a particular organic matter united to lime, which is
formed at the expense of the azotized principle contained in the
roots of the ipecac. What is the azotised principle which concurs
in the formation of this substance? Certainly it
is not one <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
of those which are commonly met with in vegetables, otherwise
the phenomenon which is observed in the tincture of ipecac
would be observed in the tinctures made with the other roots.
Is it the emetine which is decomposed? If that be the case,
the tincture of ipecac would be considered rightly an uncertain
preparation.</p>

<p>From the character assigned by M. Willigh to his ipecacuan
acid, as well as to the tribasic salt of lead, (Journal de Chimie
et de Pharmacie, Octobre, 1851,) it will be readily understood,
how I at first thought, without, however, having made any serious
researches, that it might be this acid united with the lime, to
which the precipitate was owing. But the analysis made by
that chemist, which denotes the absence of nitrogen in its composition,
does not permit us to entertain this idea.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>As will readily be perceived, my researches are far from
complete, as I had not a sufficient quantity of the precipitate at
my disposition. But while waiting to complete them, I did
not wish to delay acquainting the learned world with a fact
which appears to me extraordinary and until now unique, and
at the same time to call to it the attention of those better
situated than myself to pursue such researches.—<i>Presse Medicale

<h3>ON THE MODE OF ASCERTAINING THE PURITY
OF ESSENTIAL OIL OF BITTER ALMONDS.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Mr. Redwood laid before the meeting some samples of <i>oil
of bitter almonds</i>, prepared by different makers, together with
the results of experiments he had made with the view of ascertaining
whether or not they had been subjected to adulteration.</p>

<p>He stated, that his attention had been directed to the subject
by more than one of the dealers in this article, in consequence
of its having been represented that some of
the samples had <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
been adulterated with alcohol, an inference which had been
drawn from the fact that the suspected samples had a much
lower specific gravity than others met with in commerce.</p>

<p>He had been furnished with five samples from different
makers, the specific gravities of which were as follows:―</p>

<div><ul class="ulstnz">
<li>1. <span class="spwanada">1052.4</span></li>
<li>2. <span class="spwanada">1055.2</span></li>
<li>3. <span class="spwanada">1067.</span></li>
<li>4. <span class="spwanada">1081.</span></li>
<li>5. <span class="spwanada">1082.2</span></li></ul>
</div>

<p>The merchants having no better mode of testing the quality
of this oil than by its flavor, its specific gravity, and other
physical characters, it was important to ascertain what reliance
could be placed on this class of observations. It was well known
that spirit was sometimes mixed with it, the effect of which
would be to reduce its specific gravity, and this addition, to the
extent to which it would be likely to be made, would not impair
the flavor of the oil, or alter its sensible characters in any
other way than is above stated. The light oils were, therefore,
very naturally suspected to have been reduced with alcohol.</p>

<p>The experiments he had made in reference to this subject
had fully satisfied him that the specific gravity of essential oil
of bitter almonds, within certain limits, could not be relied on
as affording evidence of purity or adulteration. The specimens
on the table, to which he had already referred, although differing
in specific gravity to the extent of nearly thirty grains in
the thousand grain-measures, he believed to be all free from
adulteration.</p>

<p>Before describing the tests which he had found to afford the
most satisfactory indications, he described the proximate constituents
of the crude oil, which vary considerably in proportion
in different samples, and hence the differences in density and in
some of the properties of the oil.</p>

<p>According to Liebig and Gregory, crude oil of bitter almonds
consists of <i>hyduret of benzoyle</i>, <i>hydrocyanic acid</i>, <i>benzoic acid</i>,
and <i>benzoine</i>, and these probably are not its only constituents.
Of these the two first may be said to be essential constituents,
and the others accidental, being the result
of changes which <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
the hyduret of benzoyle, or true oil of bitter almonds, undergoes.</p>

<p>The <i>hyduret of benzoyle</i> has the ordinary characters of an
essential oil. When pure it is a colorless, transparent liquid,
the specific gravity of which is 1043. It possesses the peculiar
almond flavor, and is not poisonous. This, which is the true
oil of bitter almonds, ought to constitute about eighty-five or
ninety per cent. of the crude oil. When oil of vitriol is added
to pure hyduret of benzoyle the mixture acquires a dark reddish
brown color, but no other visible change takes place.</p>

<p>If the hyduret of benzoyle be exposed to the air it speedily
becomes oxidized, and by the substitution of an atom of
oxygen for one of hydrogen it is converted into benzoic acid.
The <i>benzoic acid</i> present in oil of bitter almonds is the result
of this transformation, and sometimes it occurs to such an extent
that it is deposited from the oil in crystals. Benzoic acid is not
colored by the action of oil of vitriol.</p>

<p><i>Benzoine</i> is also a product of a remarkable change which
hyduret of benzoyle, when mixed with hydrocyanic acid, is liable
to undergo. Like benzoic acid, it is a solid crystalline body,
but unlike benzoic acid, when mixed with oil of vitriol, it forms
a violet colored compound.</p>

<p>The characters and properties of <i>hydrocyanic acid</i> are too
well known to require notice. It is this constituent, which is
sometimes present to the extent of eight or ten per cent., that
gives to oil of bitter almonds its poisonous properties.</p>

<p>In examining oil of bitter almonds, with the view of determining
whether it be pure or not, it is necessary to consider the
influence on the action of the reagents employed, of variations
in the number and proportions of the several constituents present.
This is especially the case with reference to the use of
oil of vitriol as a test.</p>

<p>On adding <i>oil of vitriol</i> to the samples of oil under notice,
it was found that it formed with all of them a clear but very dark
colored mature, from which no separation took place. The
color of the mixture thus produced, however,
differed to a <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
greater or less extent in each case. The lightest of the oils
produced a reddish-brown color, similar to that afforded by
pure hyduret of benzoyle, while the heaviest oil formed a bright
red mixture, having a shade of violet, and those of intermediate
density gave intermediate shades of color.</p>

<p>These results, viewed in connection with the differences of
density in the different specimens, were at first thought to indicate
that the light specimens had some admixture foreign to
the oil, but on examining the action of the test on pure hyduret
of benzoyle and the other legitimate constituents of the crude
oil, it was evident that such an inference could not be justly
drawn, and, indeed, suspicion now seemed rather to attach to
the heavy oil. Subsequent experiments, however, showed
that the light oil distils at a lower temperature than the heavy,
and that if the heaviest specimens were distilled with water,
the first portions that passed over produced precisely the same
reaction as the light specimens above referred to, while the last
portions that passed over, and especially the oil obtained from
the water by distilling it, after saturating it with common salt,
produced with oil of vitriol a splendid crimson color, the purity
and intensity of which could hardly be surpassed.</p>

<p>It thus became pretty evident that the differences in the reaction
of oil of vitriol with the different specimens of oil under
notice, arose from variations in the circumstances under which
the oils were distilled, and it seemed probable that the heavy
oil had been obtained by distilling the almond cake with water,
to which a large quantity of salt had been added, so as to raise
the point of ebullition, while the light oil either was the product
of a process in which less salt had been added to the water,
or consisted of the first portions distilled.</p>

<p>In order to obtain more satisfactory evidence of the absence
of spirit, or other foreign substance, from these samples of oil,
<i>nitric acid</i> was used as a test. If oil of bitter almonds be mixed
with about twice its volume of nitric acid, of specific gravity
1.420, no immediate action occurs. The greater part of the oil
floats over the surface of the acid, and, if the
former be free <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
from adulteration, no change of color takes place within several
hours in either; but after the lapse of three or four days crystals
of benzoic acid will begin to be formed from the oxidation
of the hyduret of benzoyle by the nitric acid, and these will increase
in quantity until the whole becomes a solid mass of crystals,
which will gradually assume a bright emerald green color.
This reaction is very char­ac­ter­is­tic. If spirit be present in the
oil to the extent of eight or ten per cent., the acid, after a few
minutes, will begin to react upon this, and a violent effervescence
will shortly ensue, accompanied by the disengagement of
nitrous vapors.</p>

<p>By using strong nitric acid, of specific gravity not less than
1.5, the presence of a very minute quantity of spirit may be detected.
The pure oil, when mixed with an equal volume of
this strong acid, forms a clear and uniform mixture, from which
nothing separates, and which undergoes but a very slight change
of color and no other visible alteration. The presence of two
or three per cent. of spirit, however, is sufficient to cause a violent
reaction and the disengagement of nitrous vapors.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>After trying several other reagents, the foregoing were those
which were found to afford the most satisfactory results, and
appeared to be conclusive with regard to those adulterations,
likely to be practised.—<i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal, London.</i></p>

<h3>ON HOFFMAN’S ANODYNE LIQUOR.
<span class="hsmall">
BY WILLIAM PROCTER, JR.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Perhaps in no preparation in general use does the practice
of manufacturers, and the requirements of pharmacopœial authorities,
more widely differ than in the
compound spirit of <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span>
ether, universally known as Hoffman’s Anodyne Liquor. According
to the United States and London Pharmacopœias it
consists of three fluid drachms of heavy oil of wine (Oleum
Ethereum, <span class="nowrap">U. S. P.,)</span> dissolved in a mixture of eight fluid ounces
of ether and sixteen fluid ounces of alcohol. The Edinburgh
Pharmacopœia has only the simple spirit of ether, without
the oil of wine, whilst the Dublin Pharmacopœia of 1850
under the name of Spiritus Æthereus Oleosus, gives the following
formula, which includes the preparation of the oil of wine
and its subsequent solution, to make the anodyne:—Mix a pint
of alcohol and a pint and a half of oil of vitriol in a glass matrass,
adapt a Liebig’s condenser, and by heat distil until a
black froth rises. Separate the lighter etherial liquid in the
receiver, expose it for 24 hours in a capsule, wash the residual
oil with water, and dissolve it in a mixture of five fluid ounces
of ether, and ten fluid ounces of alcohol. In France, Hoffman’s
anodyne consists of equal parts of ether and alcohol,
without oil of wine.</p>

<p>Owing to the careless or intentionally mystified manner of
expressing himself, it is impossible now to ascertain whether
the original preparation of Hoffman (published in 1732) was
constant in its strength, as now recommended by the Pharmacopœia.
Beaumé, (as quoted in Macquer’s Chem. Dict., London,
1771,) says, in speaking of the rectification of sulphuric
ether, “By distilling the liquor in the first receiver, together
with a very small quantity of oil of tartar, by a very gentle
heat of a lamp furnace, about two pounds and four ounces of
pure ether may be obtained; and afterwards, when a new receiver
is adapted, and a stronger heat applied, from eight to
ten ounces of aromatic liquor, which makes a good <i>anodyne
mineral liquor of Hoffman</i>, will be distilled.”</p>

<p>The third edition of Lewis’ Dispensatory, published at Dublin,
1768, has the following formula for this preparation, which
appears to be what the apothecaries of that day employed:―</p>


<p>“<i>Hoffman’s Mineral Anodyne Liquor.</i>”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Into half a pound of concentrated oil of vitriol,
placed in a <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
large glass retort, pour by little and little, through a long stemmed
funnel, one pint and a half of highly rectified spirit of
wine. Stop the mouth of the retort, digest for some days, and
then distil with a very gentle heat. At first a fragrant spirit
of wine will arise; and after it a more fragrant volatile spirit,
to be caught in a fresh receiver. The receiver being again
changed, a sulphurous, volatile, acid phlegm comes over, and
at length a <i>sweet oil of vitriol</i>, which should be immediately
separated, lest it be absorbed by the phlegm. Mix the first
and second spirits together, and in [every] two ounces of this
mixture dissolve twelve drops of the sweet oil. If the liquor
has any sulphurous smell, re-distil it from a little salt of tartar.</p>

<p>“Whether this is the exact preparation, so much recommended
and so often prescribed by Hoffman as an anodyne
and anti-spasmodic, we cannot determine. We learn from his
own writings that his anodyne liquor was composed of the dulcified
spirit of vitriol, [crude ether] and the aromatic oil which
rises after it; but not in what proportions he mixed them together.
The College of Wirtemburg seems to think that all
the oil was mixed with all the spirit obtained in one operation
without regard to the precise quantities.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The product of this recipe must have been analogous to the
present officinal spirit, the formula for which is evidently
modeled after it. The great excess of alcohol distills over first,
until the boiling point rises to the ether producing temperature,
when ether is obtained, and finally the sulphurous oily product.
The recipe gives no direction to isolate the oil of wine before
measuring it, which is perhaps less necessary, as the ethereal part
of the distillate is removed previously to the production of the oil
which is found in the receiver in globules, and not in solution.</p>

<p>The process now adopted by the manufacturers in this city,
avoids the isolation of the oil of wine, and from the nature of
the conditions the product is liable to vary in the proportions
of its ingredients, not only in different laboratories, but at different
operations in the same laboratory. In the preparation
of ether it is usual in this city to push the process as
far as <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
possible, as long as the residue is not so concentrated as to eliminate
much permanent gas. In the rectification of this first
crude product, the distillate is reserved as rectified ether as
long as its specific gravity marks 54° Beaumé, or there about.
By continuing the process the product is found to consist of
ether, alcohol and water, impregnated with oil of wine. Every
one who has made ether, knows how very liable the product is
to vary with an ill regulated heat; on the one hand unaltered
alcohol will pass over, if the temperature is too low, whilst too
great a heat, especially towards the last of the process, will favor
the formation of oil of wine and sulphurous acid. This last
distillate, therefore, will vary in composition, and it is from this
that Hoffman’s anodyne is made in some of the best of our laboratories.
<i>There is no known practicable method of ascertaining
the per centage of heavy oil of wine in this liquid.</i> The
means used by the manufacturer are founded on the sensible
properties of an arbitrary standard specimen of Hoffman’s anodyne
previously made, and on the degree of opalesence or milkiness
it produces when added to a certain measure of water.—This
milkiness is occasioned by the oil of wine present; but
experience has shown that the degree of milkiness is not strictly
in proportion to the quantity of oil present, the relative proportion
of ether and alcohol, and perhaps water present in the
anodyne liquid has a marked influence on the phenomenon;
if too much alcohol, the milkiness is not produced, or but partially;
if too much ether, oily globules separate and float with
but moderate opalescence. In converting this second etherial
distillate into commercial Hoffman’s anodyne, the operator has
to make several essays, sometimes adding water, sometimes alcohol
or ether, until the taste, the smell, and the opalescence
agree, as nearly as can be approached, with his standard specimen.
In the process of rectification it is probable that at least
a part of the heavy oil of wine is decomposed, with the production
of the light oil or etherole, and that the commercial Hoffman’s
anodyne differs in this respect, as well as in containing
a much smaller proportion of oil of wine, from that
of the Pharmacopœia. <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span></p>

<p>To get a better idea of the preparation in use here, authentic
specimens were obtained from four of our largest manufacturing
chemists, and compared with compound spirit of ether
made for the occasion strictly according to the United States
Pharmacopœia. Their density was carefully taken with the
1000 grs. bottle.</p>

<p>Equal measures of each specimen and distilled water were
mixed together; they all produced opaque milky liquids; globules
of oil of wine soon separated from the mixture with E,
and floated on the surface, while the liquid gradually lost its
opacity as more of the oil arose. The mixture with D became
less opaque by standing, a small portion of oil rising to the surface.
The mixture with A, B and C retained their opacity
without apparent separation of oil of wine, A being the most so.</p>

<p>A was the mildest and least repulsive to the taste, because
least ethereal. C was the next least ethereal, but had pungency
not arising from ether. B was more ethereal than the preceding,
not­with­stand­ing its greater specific gravity. D was
yet more charged with ether. E presented sensible properties
differing from all the others, being more etherial and aromatic,
but without a peculiar taste noticeable in the other specimens,
more especially in C.</p>

<p>When <span class="nowrap">2&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
fluid drachms of each specimen was shaken in graduated
tubes with 60 grains of carbonate of potassa, they were
de-hydrated somewhat in the ratio of their specific gravities.
A and B dissolved the salt readily by a few minutes’ agitation,
and the separated aqueous alkaline solution equalled a third of
the bulk of the mixture. In C and D only about half of the
salt was dissolved, whilst in E the salt was merely rendered
pasty.</p>

<p>To get an idea of the proportion of ether
present in these <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
specimens, a solution of dry chloride of calcium in an equal
weight of water, was made. Five parts of this solution was
mixed with three parts of each of specimens of Hoffman’s anodyne,
in tall tubular vials, corked, well agitated and allowed to
stand for twelve hours. In A, B and C, no separation of ether
occurred, but in each of them a few globules arose to the surface,
consisting chiefly of light oil of wine. In D a stratum of
ether holding oil of wine in solution, equal to one seventh of
the bulk of the spirit used, or nearly half a part. Whilst in E
the super-stratum of ether equalled one-third of the spirit used,
and had a light yellow color, due to the oil of wine.</p>

<p>These data will give an approximative idea of their compositions;
it would appear that A was chiefly alcohol and water,
with but little ether; that B contained almost as much water
as A, but less alcohol and more ether; that C contained much
less water than A or B, but less ether and more alcohol than
B, and more ether and less alcohol than A; that D contained
rather more water than C, but more ether and less alcohol than
either of the preceding; and lastly that E contains more ether,
and less alcohol and water than either of the others.</p>

<p>In regard to the proportion of ethereal oil, the experiments
give no positive clue. It would appear that B and D contained
the most among the commercial specimens, and that D approaches
nearest the composition of the officinal spirit, yet all
of them when compared with the officinal are deficient in this
ingredient.</p>

<p>It must be apparent from these results, that the opacity of a
mixture of Hoffman’s anodyne and water, is no index of the
proportion of oil of wine the former contains, that property being
dependent apparently on the state of combination in which
the oil exists, nor would we pronounce on the medicinal value
of the specimens, a task belonging to the physician. Whatever
curative reputation the compound spirit of ether may have
earned, certainly belongs to the commercial spirit, and not to
that of the Pharmacopœia, which is not to be had in the shops.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the liquid left after
the rectification of <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
ether is an inquiry well worthy of further investigation. The
alcohol of commerce is not a homogenous substance. Besides
water, it contains odoriferous oily matter, produced in the original
fermentation, and which is not wholly removed in the
rectification of whiskey. This matter, modified by the action
of sulphuric acid and heat, with the volatile substances generated
during the ether process, are contained in it. It may also
be that the ether in this residue is more intimately combined
with water than in a mere mixture of water, alcohol, and ether
of the same strength, as suggested to me by Mr. Pemberton.</p>

<p>The question very naturally arises, why do not the manufacturers
prepare the officinal Hoffman’s anodyne, or why do
they not furnish the ethereal oil of the Pharmacopœia, that the
apothecary may make it himself by simple mixing? There are
several reasons. 1st, the apothecary, the physician, and to a
large extent the consumer, have become accustomed to the present
commercial preparation, and the majority, both of apothecaries
and physicians, would reject the true officinal spirit, if
presented to them, as not correctly made; 2d, druggists, as a
general rule, would refuse to pay the greatly increased price,
absolutely required to remunerate the manufacturer, for the
greater consumption of time and materials, and increased skill
and risk in manipulation. Having, on several occasions, prepared
the officinal oil of wine and Hoffman’s anodyne, I can
corroborate the statements of Mr. Kent, at p. 255, relative to
the small yield, and consequent costliness of officinal heavy oil
of wine. The so-called oil of wine, which is imported into this
city from England, and which is sometimes employed for
making the officinal spirit, is an ethereal solution of etherole,
one specimen yielding only seven per cent. of it. And 3d, in
the preparation of ether, the residue left in the still after the
rectification of the ether above 54° Beaumé, must either be
thrown away, or converted to the only use to which it can be
applied with advantage, viz., Hoffman’s anodyne. It is for
this reason that the price of the commercial “anodyne” is so
low, being about fifteen
cents per pound. <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span></p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>It may become a question in the next revision of the Pharmacopœia,
whether it would not be better to reconstruct the
formula for compound spirit of ether, somewhat on the plan of
the manufacturers, or that quoted at page <a href="#p213" title="go to p. 213">213,</a> from Lewis’s
Dispensatory, so as to render it more practicable and likely to
be followed. Of course it should be done with due consideration
of the difficulties involved in the production of a spirit of
uniform strength.—<i>American Journal of Pharmacy.</i></p>

<h3>ON GUTTA TABAN.
<span class="hsmall">
BY BERTHOLD SEEMANN.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The Taban (<i>Isonandra Gutta</i>, Hook.), which was formerly
so plentiful [in Singapore], has long since been extinct. A
few isolated trees may here and there occur, but they are very
scarce, and I have not been able to obtain even the sight of
one. Several of the white residents keep in their gardens as
a curiosity, a plant or two, but they grow very slowly. It must
ever be an object of regret, that on the first introduction of the
Taban gum, its proper name was not promulgated. Now everybody
in Europe and America speaks of Gutta Percha, when, in
fact, all the time they mean the Gutta Taban. The substance
termed by the Malays “Gutta Percha” is not the produce of
the <i>Isonandra Gutta</i>, Hook., but that of a botanically unknown
tree, a species of <i>Ficus</i>, I am told. The confusion of these two
names has become a popular error—an error which science
will have to rectify.</p>

<p>The exportation of the indigenous Gutta Taban from Singapore
commenced in 1844, but as early as the end
of 1847, all, <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
or at least most, of the trees had been exterminated. That at
present shipped from the place, is brought in coasting vessels
from the different ports of Borneo, Sumatra, the Malayan peninsula,
and Jahore Archipelago.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanch17">17</a>
The difference existing in
its appearance and property is owing to the intermixture of
Gutta Percha, Jelotong, Gegrek, Litchu, and other inferior
Guttas, made by the natives in order to increase the weight.—Though
far from being extinct in the Indian Archipelago, Gutta
Taban will every year be more difficult to obtain, as the
coast region is said to be pretty well cleared, and a long transport
from the interior must, by augmenting the labor, increase
the value of the article.</p>

and present Amount of Import into Singapore</i>.” Mr. Logan has promised
an article on the various substances intermixed with the Taban, a
subject of the highest interest; but he has hitherto disappointed his
readers.</p></div>

<p>A few months after the publication of your first account
of the plant, in January, 1847, an article on the same subject
appeared in the <i>Journal of the Indian Archipelago</i>, by one of
its most able contributors, Dr. T. Oxley. As that article contains
many statements not contained in yours, and as it may
possibly have escaped your notice, I shall make a few extracts
from it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Gutta Taban tree belongs to the natural order <i>Sapotaceæ</i>,
but differs so much from all described genera, that I am
inclined to consider it a new one. I shall, therefore, endeavor
to give its general character, leaving the honor of naming it to
a more competent botanist, especially as,
from want of <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
complete specimens, I have not quite satisfied myself regarding the
stamens and fruit.</p>

<p>“The tree is from sixty to seventy feet high, from two to three
feet in diameter. In its general aspect it resembles the Durian
(<i>Durio Zibethinus</i>, Linn.), so much so as to strike the most
superficial observer. The leaves are alternate, obovate-lanceolate,
entire, coriaceous, their upper surface is of a pale green,
and their under surface covered with a close, short, reddish-brown
hair. The flowers are axillary, from one to three in the
axils, supported on short curved pedicels, and numerous along
the extremities of the branches. The calyx is inferior, persistent
coriaceous, divided into six sepals, which are arranged in
double series. The corolla is monopetalous, hypogenous, and
divided, like the calyx, into six acuminate segments. The stamens,
inserted into the throat of the corolla, are in a single
series, and variable in number, but to the best of my observation,
their normal number is twelve; they are most generally
all fertile. The anthers are supported on slender bent filaments,
and open by two lateral pores. The ovary is superior,
terminated by a long single style, and six-celled; the cells are
monospermous. The fruit is unknown to me.</p>

<p>“Only a short time ago the Taban tree was tolerably abundant
on the Island of Singapore, but already, (middle of 1847)
all the large timber has been felled. Its geographical range,
however, appears to be considerable, it being found all up the
Malayan peninsula, as far as Penang, where I have ascertained
it to be plentiful. Its favorite localities are the alluvial tracts
on the foot of hills, where it forms the principal portion of the
jungle.</p>

<p>“The quantity of solid gutta obtained from each tree varies
from five to twenty catties, so that, taking the average of ten
catties, which is a tolerably liberal one, it will require the destruction
of ten trees to produce one picul. Now, the quantity
exported from Singapore to Europe, from the 1st of January,
1845, to the middle of 1847, amounted to 6,918
piculs, to obtain <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
which, 69,180 trees must have been sacrificed! How much
better would it be to adopt the method of tapping the tree
practised by the Burmese, in obtaining the caoutchouc, than to
continue the present process of
extermination.”<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanch18">18</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A mercantile house in Singapore lately received from Manilla
a gum which was supposed by those who sent it to be
Gutta Taban, but proved a different substance. It was accompanied
by specimens of the tree producing it, and a note stating
that the gum abounded in the Philippine Islands. As it will
probably make its appearance in England, and perhaps become
of some importance, I may add that those specimens presented
to me by the merchant, belong to the genus <i>Ficus</i>; but whether
to a new or an already described species, want of books
prevented me from determining.—<i>Hooker’s Jour. of Botany.</i></p>

<h3>ON GAMBIR.
<span class="hsmall">
BY BERTHOLD SEEMAN.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Black pepper (<i>Piper Nigrum</i>, Linn.) and Gambir (<i>Uncaria
Gambir</i>, Roxb.) are grown in great quantities [in Singapore],
and exclusively by the Chinese, for both these articles are so
exceedingly cheap, that Europeans have not deemed it worth
their while to engage in the speculation. Pepper and Gambir
plantations are always combined, because the refuse of the
gambir leaves serve as an excellent manure for the pepper; and
moreover, what is of equal, if not greater importance, kills the
Lalang, (<i>Andropogon caricosus</i>, Linn.), a plant which, like
the couch-grass (<i>Triticum repens</i>, Linn.), spreads with astonishing
rapidity over the fields, growing so close together and
so high, that within a short spate of
time valuable plantations <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
are rendered useless, and many have to be given up from the
utter impossibility of freeing the ground from this weed.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The process by which gambir is extracted and prepared is
simple. The leaves are boiled in water, until all their astringent
property is extracted. The decoction is then poured into
another vessel, in which it becomes inspissated, and, when
nearly dry, is cut in small square pieces, and thus brought into
the market. M’Culloch states that sago is used in thickening
it. This, however, at least in Singapore, is not the case; but,
instead of sago, a piece of wood is dipped into the vessel, by
which the desired effect is produced. It must, indeed, be an
extraordinary substance, the mere dipping of which into the
fluid can cause it to become a thickened mass. I was very
eager to obtain a piece of this wood; unluckily, the Chinaman
whose laboratory I visited, could not be persuaded to part with
his, and a friend of mine, who was exerting himself to procure
a sample, had not succeeded at the time of the Herald’s departure:
he promised, however, to send it to England, accompanied
by the Malayan name, and specimens of the tree.—<i>Hooker’s

<div class="section">
<h3>ON THE GALBANUM PLANT.
<span class="hsmall">
BY F. A. BUSHE.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The author states, that in his travels in Persia he discovered
the plant which yields galbanum. In June, 1848, he found it
on the declivities of the Demawend. It is a ferula, from the
stalks of which a liquid issues abundantly, by the odor and nature
of which he immediately recognised galbanum, and his
guides assured him, moreover, that galbanum is gathered from
this plant. The author has not
yet distinctly determined <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
the plant. It appears to differ from <i>Ferula erubescens</i> (<i>Annales
des Sciences</i>, iii., Sér. 1844, p. 316,) only by the absence
of commissural vitæ; but as neither Aucher-Eloy, nor Kotschy,
who have both collected the Ferula erubescens, make any
mention of its yielding galbanum, the author is in doubt whether
his plant be the same, or a variety of it. Don’s genus
galbanum (Trib. Sibrinæ) and Lindley’s Opaïdia (Trib. Smyrneæ)
do not agree with the plant seen by Bushe, unless that
both of these authors have made their descriptions from imperfect
fruits, or that there exist other plants which yield galbanum.—The
plant which Bushe describes is called in some parts of
Persia, <i>Khassuch</i>, (not <i>Kasneh</i>, which means Cichor intybus,
nor Gäshnis, which is Coriand. sativum), and appears to be
confined to certain districts of Persia. In the whole large district
of the Elburs-chain, from the south-east angle to the south-west
angle of the Caspian Sea, it is only found in the neighborhood
of the Demawend; but here at an elevation of from 4000
to 8000 feet, and even on the declivity of the top of the Demawend.
It exists neither on the mountains of Talysch, nor in
the districts of Karadagh and Tabris. It is said to re-appear
on the Mount Alwend, near Hamadan, and in the neighborhood
of the great salt desert. Near Hamadan Aucher-Eloy
has gathered his Ferula erubescene, and this supports the supposition
that the author’s plant is the same. In the salt desert
itself Bushe did not meet with it again. The inhabitants of the
Demawend collect the gum resin, which issues spontaneously
from the lower part of the stalk; they do not make incisions in
the plant; but it is not at this place that the galbanum is collected
for commercial purposes. When fresh, the gum resin is
white like milk, liquid, and somewhat glutinous. In the air
it soon becomes yellow, elastic, and finally solid. The odor
is rather strong, unpleasant, and similar to that of our commercial
galbanum.—<i>Central Blatt</i>, für
1852, No. xiii.</p>

<p>Open quackery was at one time contented with the market-place and the stage;
its merits and achievements were announced only by the lungs of its professors
and their assistants. We have changed all that. Quackery has improved with
the age. It has got possession of the newspapers, and forces its way in the pulpit;
it has its colleges and graduates, it edits journals and writes books; but it
has changed its form, not its spirit; at bottom it is as shameless, and lying and
rediculous as ever. While its essence is eternal its form is constantly changing.
A variety springs up, flourishes, attains its maturity, then dies away, to be replaced
by another, or to be revived in a distant country or a future generation.
The facilities of intercommunication afforded by railroad and steam vessels yield
the same advantage to imposture and credulity, that they give to science and
truth. We import nonsense and humbug as well as silks and dry goods. But
as was observed on another occasion, home manufacture has sprung up, and we
have become exporters as well as importers. Spiritual knocking are set off against
Mesmerism; Thompsonianism is sent in exchange for Hygeia; native Sarsaparillas
have driven the foreign from the market; Mormonism goes a long way to
balance Homeopathy, while the “Great Harmonican,” in size, in pretension and
in absurdity, is scarcely to be rivalled any where in the present age.</p>

<p>The newest delusion that pretends to be a system, Kinesipathy, is, in the country
of its origin, already several years old. It comes to us from Sweden, and recommends
the treatment of diseases by means of various exercises, and above all,
blows on different parts of the body. All these are set forth with the greatest
gravity, and defined and commented on with as much precision as if the author
was bringing forward a National Pharmacopœia. In the treatment of disease
the motives, positions, and blows, are varied in the strangest, and often most ludicrous
manner. Witness the following <i>prescription</i> for gonorrhea, which is
complete except as the author states “some movements depending on particular
circumstances.”</p>

<p>1. “Percussion on the sacrum in the stride standing position.</p>

<p>2. “Transversal chopping on the neck in the sitting position.</p>

<p>3. “Pressure above the os pubis in the lying position, with elevated back,
while the separated and bent legs are drawn towards the abdomen. Vibration
of the perineum, in the same position.”</p>

<p>“The treatment begins with percussing the sacrum, in the stride standing position,
which in the first day or two not only allays and relieves the more violent
inflammation and copious secretion, but also changes the whole state of the disease
in such a manner, that the following treatment
by movements, (different <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
according to the state of the patient,) produces an increased flow of arterial
blood in the upper extremities, and the cure is very much accelerated. In the
first stage, during which only moderate stitching pains, tension, and little secretion
appears; the percussion on the sacrum alone is sufficient, if repeated three
or four times daily. If the symptoms become more violent, and accompanied by
chordee and pain during urinating, &amp;c., then other movements are necessary,
then make use of the transversal chopping of the neck, which acts strongly
against the chordee, and of the pressure above the os pubis in the above mentioned
lying position, which increases the venous absorption of the bladder and
sexual organs, by its effect on the excited nerves of these parts. In the second
period if the urinating is very difficult, the perineum swollen and painful, the
discharge mixed with blood, and fever is present, then a more general treatment
is necessary. To increase the more local absorption in the urethra, vibrations
along the whole tract of the perineum from before backward are employed.”</p>

<p>That percussion on the sacrum has long been known as a remedial measure in
moral complaints we are perfectly aware, but that it was to become an article of
materia medica is something new under the sun!</p>

<p>Kinesipathy has not yet, we believe, been formally introduced into the United
States, but we hear that a new set of quacks, who call themselves Psychologists,
have adopted something from its rules, and are employing “percussions and flagellations”
as one of their means for the cure of the various ills that flesh is heir too.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>After all some partial truth, long well known and acted on by the profession,
as is the case in most successful quackeries, underlies Kinesipathy. Exercise and
stimulation of the external surface, are in themselves exceedingly beneficial, and
under the influence of a charlatan, patients will submit to a discipline, which if
directed by a physician would never receive more than momentary attention.</p>

employed in the formation of suppositories, for which it is admirably adapted,
by its consistence, and by the facility with which it becomes liquid at the temperature
of the body. Some times a good deal of difficulty is encountered in incorporating
it with laudanum, chloroform, extracts and solutions. In such cases
M. Stanislas Martin recommends that the butter be first moulded in the desired
form, and that then a cavity be formed in it, by means of an iron wire slightly
warmed, sufficiently large to contain the prescribed medicine. The orifice can
then be closed with a thin layer of the butter of cacao, formed by rubbing a morsel
of it upon an iron spatula, or the blade of a knife slightly warmed in a spirit
lamp.</div>

<p>A number of the suppositories thus prepared beforehand, can be preserved in
envelopes which serve them for a mould, these being removed only when they
are about to be used.</p>

<h4>DELEGATES TO THE CONVENTION FOR 1852.</h4>

<p>At a meeting of the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York, held June
28th, Messrs. George D. Coggesshall, William Hegeman and L. S. Haskell, were
elected Delegates from this College to the National Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Convention,
to meet at Philadelphia, on the first Monday in October next. It was resolved
that in case of any disability of either of their number to attend, the remaining
delegates should be authorised to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>The re-issue of President Guthrie’s official call for the meeting of the Convention
was expected in time for this number of the Journal, but has not been received.
It will doubtless appear in our next with a further notice of this important
subject.</p>

<h4>AMOUNT OF LOSS IN POWDERING VARIOUS
DRUGS.</h4>

<p>The following results are from the mill returns of a drug
house in this city. They show the actual loss incurred in powdering
these different articles, and are, so far, of service by indicating
the practical loss arising from the process.</p>

<p>As the per centage of loss varies very much with the quantity
subjected to the process, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, the quantities of each
parcel are also given.</p>

<h3>ON THE PREPARATIONS OF IRON USED IN
MEDICINE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY HENRY WURTZ.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The preparations of iron being among the most important
articles of the Pharmacopœia, it is surprising that so little attention
is paid by many druggists and phar­ma­ceu­tists to the
preparation and preservation of these articles in a pure state.
The greater part of the preparations of iron to be found in the
shops are far from having the chemical composition indicated
by their labels, and in fact, few of the formulas given in any
of the Pharmacopœias for preparations of iron, are capable of
giving even tolerably pure products.</p>

<p>If there is any difference in a therapeutical point of view,
between compounds of the protoxide and compounds of the
peroxide of iron, and if any value is to be attached to definite
composition in medicines, enabling physicians to administer
<i>known quantities</i> to their patients, this state of affairs should
not exist. Persons who handle the compounds of protoxide of
iron, should be aware of the fact that few substances are more
speedily and completely destroyed than these by
the action of <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
moist air; thus, one hundred parts of the <i>carbonate of iron</i>, require
less than seven parts of oxygen for complete conversion into
<i>sesquioxide of iron</i>, and one hundred parts of pure <i>copperas</i>
require less than <i>three</i> parts of the same element to effect a
like change in all the protoxide of iron which it contains.</p>

<p>As these protoxide of iron compounds, however, oxydate
themselves only in the presence of water, the mode of preservation
which I would propose, is very simple: It is only necessary
to dry them perfectly and to introduce into the vessels in
which they are to be preserved, a few small lumps of <i>quicklime</i>,
which will keep the air in the interior of the vessel
continually dry. To prevent any contamination of the preparation
by direct contact with the lime, the latter must be
securely folded in one or two thicknesses of filtering paper.</p>

<p>The iodide of iron and the carbonate, phosphate, arseniate,
lactate and citrate of protoxide of iron may be preserved in
this way, also the anhydrous sulphate (Ferri Sulphas Siccatum),
but it is evident that <i>crystallized</i> copperas would not retain a
definite composition under these circumstances, because it
would soon lose its crystal water. To preserve crystallized
copperas, it is best to pulverize the crystals rather finely and
dry the powder by repeatedly pressing strongly between folds
of filtering paper, before putting up. Some have attempted
to preserve the crystals under the surface of strong alcohol, but
having tried this plan I must report unfavorably, for although
the copperas remained for a while intact, yet, on examination
after a considerable lapse of time, a large proportion of sesquioxide
of iron was found. In fact, this result was to be anticipated
in consideration of the well-known fact that strong
alcohol has itself an attraction for oxygen, and always absorbs
a certain amount of it when exposed to the air, serving
thus merely as a medium for transmitting oxygen to any copperas
which may be immersed in it.</p>

<p>I think it may be confidently stated that none of the protoxide
compounds of iron should be kept in solution, either in
water or alcohol, for medical purposes, unless
in vessels <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
hermetically closed. Some say, not­with­stand­ing, that <i>iodide of
iron</i> in solution may be preserved by keeping in it a piece of
metallic iron, a deposite being formed, however, in the liquid
which is supposed to be nothing more than sesquioxide of iron,
but in which I strongly suspect the presence of a <i>subiodide of
iron</i>, and consequent abstraction of iodine from the solution.
Of course, however, this question can only be settled by a
chemical examination of the deposit alluded to.</p>

<p>The sulphate of iron is the starting point in preparing all the
compounds of iron which are used in medicine, and it is important
therefore, to know how to separate easily the impurities
which are contingent to this extremely cheap article of commerce.
The impurities which commercial copperas most frequently
contains are more or less sulphate of sesquioxide, together
with a little sesquichloride of iron, and more rarely, traces
of the sulphate of copperas, manganese, alumina and lime.
A small addition of <i>oxide of silver</i> to the solution will precipitate
all chlorine present, and subsequent digestion for a few
minutes with <i>carbonate of baryta</i> will remove every trace of
sulphate of sesquioxide of iron, and of alumina. Copper may, of
course, be removed by immersion of metallic iron. Traces of
lime may be separated by re­crys­tal­li­za­tion, but if traces of
<i>manganese</i> are present, as is sometimes the case, I, know no
way by which it can be separated. I am not aware, however,
that the presence of such a trace of manganese in a preparation
of iron would impair its therapeutical value. Another method
of getting rid of the sulphate of sesquioxide is to acidulate the
solution with sulphuric acid and, agitate with some pulverized
<i>protosulphide of iron</i>, which will reduce the sesquioxide to
protoxide.</p>

<p>When a solution of pure sulphate of protoxide of iron, free
from sesquioxide, merely is required for preparing the carbonate
or other insoluble protocompound, the method with carbonate
of baryta is to be preferred, and in some rare cases
when the presence of sulphate of lime in the solution of copperas
obtained is of no importance, carbonate of lime
may be <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
substituted for carbonate of baryta, and will accomplish the same
object.</p>

<p>When a solution of pure protosulphate of iron thus obtained
is used for the preparation of carbonate of iron, care must be
taken to use for precipitating, a solution of carbonate of soda
which is free from silica, phosphoric acid, etc., which if present
would surely go down with the precipitate. The precipitated
carbonate should be washed with water which has been freed
from <i>air</i> by previous boiling and better with water which is
still boiling hot, dried as quickly as possible, first by pressure
between folds of paper and then in a water bath, and preserved
in well closed vessels containing lumps of quicklime as recommended
above.</p>

<p>The formulas given in the Pharmacopœias for the preparation
of the sesquioxide of iron, which besides being employed as a
remedy itself, is used in preparing all the other sesquicompounds
of iron used in Pharmacy, appear to be open to great
objection on the ground of affording, instead of a pure sesquioxide
of iron, an <i>indefinite mixture</i> of sesquioxide with carbonate
of the protoxide. No necessity whatever exists for this;
the following <i>modus operandi</i>, besides being much less troublesome
in its execution than those given by the Pharmacopœias,
will furnish a product of constant composition, being an anhydrous
sesquioxide of iron free from protoxide, and either chemically
pure or very nearly so. The materials required are, five
parts of commercial copperas which has been recrystallized
once or twice, six parts of crystallized pure carbonate of soda,
(Na&#x202f;O,&#x202f;C&#x202f;O<sup>2</sup> + 10&#x202f;HO) or two parts of dry carbonate of soda,
and one part of nitrate of soda. (Chili saltpetre). The carbonate
and nitrate of soda are dissolved together in one portion
of hot water and the copperas in another portion, and the
two solutions, after filtrating mixed together, evaporated to
dryness and the dry mass exposed to the lowest possible red
heat for a few minutes. On pouring water upon the mass thus
obtained, sulphate of soda and nitrate of soda dissolve and sesquioxide
of iron separates as a heavy powder
very easily washed <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
by decantation. When thoroughly washed and dried it appears
as a dark reddish brown <i>perfectly impalpable</i> powder, which
is perfectly and easily soluble in dilute acids, and even in
acetic acid and the composition of which is Fe<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;O<sup>3</sup>.</p>

<p>One great advantage of this process, is an avoidance of the
immense tedium of <i>washing the precipitates</i> obtained in the
ordinary processes.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>I have but one more suggestion to make with regard to preparations
of iron, and that is in the preparation of <i>Ferri
Pulvis</i> or powder of iron by reduction of the sesquioxide—to
propose the substitution of common coal gas as a reducing
agent for the hydrogen gas directed by all the formulas, the
former being obviously so vastly more convenient and far less
expensive.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON THE PREPARATION OF BESTUCHEFF’S TINCTURE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY FR. MAŸER.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Pure sesqui-chloride and poto-chloride of iron are unknown
to the Pharmacopœia of the United States, a fact which seems
strange to a German pharmaceutist, since they are met with
in every German dispensatory, and require great care for their
proper preparation.</p>

<p>The American Pharmacopœia indeed recognizes a tincture
of chloride of iron, prepared by dissolving the sub-carbonate
(sesqui oxide) of iron in hydrochloric acid, and adding alcohol.
This tincture would be rejected throughout Germany, since
they endeavor there to obtain the preparations of perchloride of
iron free from any traces of sesqui-chloride, while those of the
sesqui-chloride should contain no admixture of the proto salt.
This shows the practical character of
the American <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
Pharmacopœia, which does not demand of the apothecary a purity of
preparation which it is next to impossible to meet.</p>

<p>While making this acknowledgment, a good formula for the
preparation of sesqui-chloride of iron still remains desirable.—This
drug too, is sometimes used in American practice, as may
be seen from the “Notes on Pharmacy,” by Mr. Benjamin
Canavan, in the May number of the <i>New York Journal of
Pharmacy</i>. Mr. Canavan has given one of the oldest formulæ
from the Austrian Pharmacopœia of 1820, as found in the
<i>Pharmacopie Universelle</i> by Jourdan. This formula directs
us to dissolve the iron in a kind of aqua regia, and then to
evaporate the superfluous acid by means of a sand bath. The
sesqui-chloride thus obtained is employed in the preparation of
“Bestucheff’s tincture,” by dissolving one ounce of it in an
ounce of water, adding twelve ounces of ether and agitating,
then decanting the ethereal solution, and finally mixing it with
four times its bulk of alcohol.</p>

<p>Having had frequent occasion to prepare this tincture as
well in Germany as in this city, it may not be unsuitable if I
give here the formula for its preparation, which seems to me
the most convenient, as well as my reasons for thinking so.</p>

<p>The sesqui-chloride of iron may be obtained in a pure and
neutral state, by passing a current of chlorine gas through a
solution of proto-chloride of iron, until a solution of the red
ferrocyanide of potassium of Gmelin no longer produces a blue
precipitate, and then evaporating the solution by means of a
water bath. In this manner the salt can readily be obtained
in a crystalline form. One ounce of the crystals thus obtained
is to be dissolved in twelve ounces of ether, if we retain the alleged
proportions, mixed with four times its bulk of alcohol,
and finally bleached by exposing it to the direct light of the
sun.</p>

<p>The Prussian Pharmacopœia of 1846 gives the following proportions:—One
drachm of the sesqui-chloride of iron, or two
drachms of the aqueous solution, one fluid ounce of ether, and
three fluid
ounces of alcohol. <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span></p>

<p>Here we have to notice,—1st, That it is preferable to take
ether and alcohol by weight rather than by measure, since their
volume is very much influenced by the temperature, which
may range from 32° to 60° or 80.°</p>

<p>2nd, That the sesqui-chloride, prepared with nitro-nuriatic
acid, is not so easy to obtain in crystals, in consequence of the
adhering nitro-nuriatic acid, which is always retained in small
quantities. On the other hand, by drying the salt you will, in
almost every case, spoil a quantity of it by driving off too much
of the acid.</p>

<p>3rd, That the sesqui-chloride of iron, if in crystals, is easily
and wholly soluble in ether, while the aqueous solution of it is
but partially so, a portion being decomposed, as is evidenced
by the solution becoming muddy. The ethereal solution, if
prepared in the last mentioned manner, must be of uncertain
strength, which is avoided by the first.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>In Europe Bestucheff’s tincture is much used by physicians.
It sometimes agrees better in the bleached state, sometimes
when colored. When first prepared the tincture has a yellow
hue, which it loses by exposure to the light of the sun. If, after
it has thus been bleached, it is placed in a dark closet, it again
becomes yellowish, though the color is not so deep as at first.</p>

<h3>ON SOCOTRINE ALOE JUICE, OR LIQUID SOCOTRINE ALOES.
<span class="hsmall">
BY JONATHAN PEREIRA, M. D., F. R. S.,</span>
<span class="htiny">
(Physician to the London Hospital.)</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>It has long been known that the Socotrine aloes imported
into England varies considerably in its consistency, and is sometimes
met with in a soft or semi-fluid state. Frequently, on
opening a package of this sort of aloes, the interior
is found to <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
be quite soft, while the exterior is firm and hard. In general
this arises from insufficient evaporation of the aloe juice.</p>

<p>In the third edition of my <i>Elements of Materia Medica</i>,
(vol. ii., part 1, p. 1077, published in 1850,) I have briefly referred
to a soft or semi-liquid Socotrine aloes, which had a
bright or palm-oil yellow color and odor. At that time I had but
little opportunity of investigating this very interesting drug;
but a large importation of it having recently taken place, I have
more fully examined it, and, as it appears to me to be the raw
or unboiled juice of the plant yielding what is known in commerce
as Socotrine aloes, I propose to distinguish it from the
ordinary soft Socotrine aloes by the name of “<i>Socotrine Aloe
Juice</i>.”</p>

<p>Messrs. Horner, the holders of the whole of the present importation
of this juice, inform me that it was purchased of the
Arabs up the Red Sea, by a merchant, who was assured by the
venders that it was very fine aloe juice, and had not been boiled
or otherwise altered. It was imported into London by way of
Madras, in casks each containing six cwt. I am informed that
the contents of some of the packages have undergone decomposition
during the voyage.</p>

<p>Its consistence is that of treacle or very thin honey; its color
deep orange or palm oil yellow; its odor powerful, fragrant,
and resembling that of fine Socotrine aloes. By standing it
separates into two parts,—an inferior, paler colored, opaque,
finely granular portion, and a superior, darker colored, transparent
liquid. The latter forms, however, a very small portion
of the whole mass.</p>

<p>When the granular portion is submitted to microscopic examination,
it is found that the opacity and granular appearance
arise from myriads of beautiful prismatic crystals. If a temperature
of 132° Fah. be applied to the juice these crystals
melt or dissolve, and the juice becomes deep red and transparent;
and when the liquid becomes cold it retains its transparency,
and does not deposit any crystals. By evaporation the
juice yields a solid, transparent extract, having
all the <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
characters of fine Socotrine aloes, in which no traces of crystalline texture
can be discovered. Mr. Jacob Bell has ascertained that
<span class="nowrap">14 lbs.</span>
of the juice yield 8lbs. 12ozs. of solid extract, or
<span class="nowrap">62&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span> per cent.
when the juice is mixed with cold distilled water, it becomes
opaque yellow, and renders the water turbid, but is not miscible
with it. If, however, heat be applied, the juice dissolves
in the water, forming an almost clear, rich red liquid. As the
solution cools, it at first becomes turbid, owing to the separation
of an opaque yellow precipitate, which, apparently, is the
crystalline principle in an amorphous form. This gradually
separates from the liquid and collects as a clear resiniform mass
(commonly called the <i>resin</i> of aloes) at the bottom of the vessel,
leaving the supernatant liquid tolerably clear. If the juice
be shaken up with rectified spirit of wine, an uniform clear
mixture is obtained, from which numerous yellow crystals rapidly
fall to the bottom of the liquid. Similar results are obtained
when we mix the juice with equal parts of rectified
spirit of wine and water.</p>

<p>This crystalline constituent of Socotrine aloes is doubtless,
either the <i>aloin</i><a class="aftntanc" href="#fn21" id="fnanch21">21</a>
described by Messrs. T. &amp; H. Smith, of Edinburgh,
and by Dr. Stenhouse, or a principle closely allied to it.</p>

<p>Dr. Stenhouse, to whom I have given a sample of it, is now
engaged in its investigation; and in a letter which I have received
from him, he says, that though he has not been able to
get the aloin ready for analysis, yet from the experiments he
has already made with it, he has scarcely a doubt that it will
be found identical with that formerly obtained from Barbados
aloes. It forms, he adds, a precisely similar combination with
bromine, and, in short, agrees with it in every particular; I
shall, therefore, provisionally term this crystalline principle
the <i>aloin of Socotrine aloes</i>. On comparing it with a fine
specimen of aloin, kindly presented to me by Messrs. Smith, I
find its crystals smaller and more tapering—the summits of the
crystals being more acute.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

See New York Journal of Pharmacy, No. vi.
page <a href="#p177" title="go to p. 177">177.</a></p></div>

<p>In drying, the crystals of the Socotrine
aloin have a strong <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
tendency to break up; so that crystals which in the moist state
are moderately large and regular, become small and pulverulent
when dry. Like the aloin crystals of Messrs. Smith, the
aloin crystals of Socotrine aloes, strongly doubly refract and
depolarize light, and are, therefore, beautiful objects when
viewed by the polarizing microscope.</p>

<p>The crystals of aloin contained in Socotrine aloe juice cannot
be confounded with the crystals of oxalate and phosphate of
lime found in the juices of various plants, and which are called
by botanists <i>raphides</i>. The appearance under the microscope
of the former is very different from that of the latter. Moreover,
the ready fusibility, solubility, and complete combustibility
of aloin crystals easily distinguish them from the calcareous
salts just referred to. On platinum foil the aloin burns
without leaving any residue, except such as may arise from the
presence of traces of some foreign matter.</p>

<p>Aloin may be readily obtained from the juice by mixing the
latter with spirit (either rectified or proof,) and collecting and
drying the precipitate. When procured in this way it appears
to the naked eye like a yellow powder; but when examined by
the microscope it is found to consist of minute fragments of
crystals.</p>

<p>The tincture from which the aloin has been separated, yields
by distillation a spirit having the fragrant odor of the juice;
showing that the latter contains some volatile odorous principle.
By evaporation the tincture yields a resiniform extract.</p>

<p>In the first edition of my <i>Elements of Materia Medica</i>, published
1840, I have stated, that by digesting hepatic aloes in
rectified spirit of wine, a yellowish granular powder is obtained
which is insoluble in [cold] water, alcohol, ether, and dilute
sulphuric acid, but is readily soluble in a solution of caustic
potash, forming a red colored liquid. The powder like residue
here referred to, is identical with the aloin of Socotrine aloes.
When examined by the microscope, it is perceived to consist
of very minute prismatic crystals, which depolarize polarized
light like the larger crystals of aloin above
referred to. I <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span>
think, therefore, that it may be safely inferred that hepatic
aloes has been prepared without the employment of artificial
heat, and that its opacity is due to the presence of minute crystals
of aloin.</p>

<p>When Socotrine aloes is digested in rectified spirit, an insoluble
portion is also obtained; but its color, instead of being
yellow, as in hepatic aloes, is dark brown. On submitting this
dark brown insoluble portion to microscopic examination, I
find that it contains depolarizing crystals.</p>

<p>Artificial Socotrine aloes (prepared by evaporating this aloe
juice) also yields, when digested in rectified spirit, a dark
brown insoluble portion.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that Socotrine aloes differs from hepatic
aloes in the circumstance of its having been prepared by the
aid of artificial heat; by which its aloin constituent has become
altered. This inference is further substantiated by the
fact, that after it has been melted, hepatic aloes is found to
have acquired the clearness and transparency of the Socotrine
sort.</p>

<p>The clear supernatant portion of aloe juice, from which the
above crystals have subsided, would probably also yield, by
spontaneous evaporation, an extract resembling, or identical
with, Socotrine aloes.</p>

<p>That Socotrine and hepatic aloes were obtained from the same
plant, and were not different species of aloes, I have long suspected;
and in the first edition of my work on Materia Medica,
published in 1840, I have observed that “the similarity of the
odor of Socotrine and hepatic aloes leads to the suspicion that
they are obtained from the same plant; and which is further
confirmed by the two being sometimes brought over intermixed,
the Socotrine occasionally forming a vein in a cask of the hepatic
aloes.”</p>

<p>The intermixture of the two sorts of aloes in the same cask
might be explained by supposing that the consolidation of the
clear portion of the juice has produced the so-called Socotrine
aloes; while the opaque aloin containing portion of juice has
yielded what is
termed hepatic aloes. <span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span></p>

<p>In the third edition of my work above alluded to, I have stated
that the name of <i>opaque liver-colored Socotrine aloes</i> might
with propriety be applied to hepatic aloes. But until the present
time I have been unable to offer a plausible explanation
of the cause of the difference in these two commercial kinds of
aloes.</p>

<p>From the preceding remarks I think we may infer:</p>

<p>1. That <i>aloin</i> pre-exists in a crystalline form in the juice of
Socotrine aloes.</p>

<p>2. That the substance which deposits as a decoction of Socotrine
aloes cools, and which is usually termed the <i>resin</i> or the
<i>resinoid</i> of Socotrine aloes, is the aloin in a modified state.</p>

<p>3. That hepatic aloes<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn22" id="fnanch22">22</a>
is the juice of the Socotrine aloes
plant which has been solified without the aid of artificial heat.</p>

<p>4. That hepatic aloes owes its opacity to the presence of minute
crystals of aloin.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>5. That the juice of Socotrine aloes yields, when evaporated
by artificial heat, an extract possessing all the properties of
commercial Socotrine aloes.—<i>Pharm. Journ. April, 1852.</i></p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch22" id="fn22">22</a>
By the term “<i>hepatic aloes</i>” I mean the opaque
liver-colored aloes imported into England from the East Indies (usually
from Bombay). This sort of aloes is very different from the <i>hepatic
Barbadoes aloes</i>, which formerly appears to have been exclusively
called “hepatic aloes.”</p></div>

<h3>THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF COD-LIVER OIL.
<span class="hsmall">
BY DR. H. L. WINCKLER.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Of all the drugs which have been introduced into medical practice
within the last ten years, none has excited so much attention,
and has met with so favorable a reception, as cod-liver oil. To
what principles its peculiar properties are to be referred, has
not yet been ascertained. By some they
have been attributed <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
to the presence of a small quantity of iodine; but this has not
proved a satisfactory explanation. Many chemists have endeavoured
to solve this problem, but without success.—Amongst
others, Dr. de Jongh, who attributed its virtue to
gaduin—a new principle which he had discovered in the oil,
with the usual fatty acids, and some of the constituents of bile,
and traces of iodine and bromine.</p>

<p>The results of my researches are different, in an important
degree. According to my experience, cod-liver oil is <i>an organic
whole</i> of a peculiar character, differing in its chemical
composition from any of the fat oils which have been heretofore
applied to medical purposes.</p>

<p>The evidences for this conclusion are the following:―</p>

<p>1. When the clear, pale cod-liver oil is saponified with potash,
and the resulting soap treated with tartaric acid, oleic and
margaric acids are obtained.</p>

<p>2. When a mixture of six parts of caustic potash, twenty-four
parts of distilled water, and twenty-four parts of cod-liver
oil, after being allowed to remain at an ordinary temperature,
and often shaken, and finally diluted with twenty-four parts of
distilled water, is distilled, a distillate is obtained, which possesses
an intense odor of cod-liver oil, and contains an appreciable
quantity of a peculiar organic compound, namely, oxide
of propyl.</p>

<p>3. When nine parts of cod-liver oil are saponified with five
parts of oxide of lead, with the necessary quantity of distilled
water, in a porcelain vessel, by the heat of a water bath, the
oil is decomposed into oleic and margaric acids, and a new
acid propylic acid. The chief part of this acid combines, like
the oleic and margaric acids, with the oxide of lead, as it appears,
to form a basic compound; and another lead salt, probably an
acid one, can be washed out of the plaister with distilled water.
It is worthy of remark, that no glycerine is formed in this process.
The plaister smells of train oil and herrings; and when
it is exposed in a thin layer to the action of the atmosphere in
a water bath, it becomes colored dark brown,
after the <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
evaporation of the water; and by the same means it loses its penetrating
odor. The cause of the coloring is due to the strong
disposition which the salts of propylic acid possess to oxidize,
and consequently, to become brown. When the solution of
the acid propylate of lead is treated with sulphuretted hydrogen,
after the separation of the sulphuret of lead, is obtained
an entirely colorless and strongly acid reacting solution, which
by evaporation in a water bath, becomes by degrees colored.
At the commencement of the last part of the operation it
loses its penetrating odor, and at last leaves a dark brown residue.
Exactly in the same manner, the watery solutions of
neutral propylates of barytes and ammonia behave themselves.
The neutral, colorless, and undecomposed ammoniacal salt
smells of herrings; and the baryta salt, as concentrated decoction
of meat.</p>

<p>4. When the before-described (No. 2) solution of cod-liver
oil soap is thrown into a capacious distillery apparatus, with the
addition of caustic lime and chloride of ammonium, (in the
proportion of six drachms of caustic potash, three ounces of
cod-liver oil, six ounces of water, six ounces of fresh burnt
lime, and one drachm of chloride of ammonium,) with the
precaution, that the mixture of lime and chloride of ammonium
be not added until the soap is formed in the retort, so that it
may penetrate thoroughly the mass, and the distillation proceeded
with by means of a gentle heat, as the formation of
hydrate of lime evolves considerable heat, there distils rather
quickly a clear, watery fluid, over which is a concentrated
solution of propylamin free from ammonia. By saturating
this solution with diluted sulphuric acid, and adding alcohol,
sulphate of propylamin readily crystallizes out of it.</p>

<p>This simple experiment serves to prove, with certainty, that
cod-liver oil contains oxide of propyl. The propylamin thus
obtained possesses all the properties of that obtained from the
pickle of herrings, or ergot of rye.</p>

<p>Cod-liver oil by saponification with potash, is separated into
oleic and margaric acids, and <i>oxide of propyl</i>;
and with oxide <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
of lead, into oleic and margaric acids, and propylic acid—a
higher result of the oxidation of propyl—and gives by either
process of saponification no <i>hydrate of the oxide of glycyl</i>.
The glycyl (C<sub>6</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>3</sub>) is in this oil replaced by propyl (C<sub>6</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>7</sub>).
Only in cod-liver oil are the conditions offered for the formation
of propylamin (N&#x202f;H<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;C<sub>6</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>7</sub>), by the presence of ammonia,
as all the fat oils employed in medicine are free from this
substance; therefore none of these oils can be substituted for
cod-liver oil.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>[Should this research of Winckler, as to the existence of the
hydrate of the oxide of propyl in combination with the fatty
acids in cod-liver oil, be confirmed, it will establish an important
fact in chemistry, and may explain the therapeutic action
of that remedy which has heretofore puzzled both chemists and
physicians. The combinations of the radical propyl have been
previously only known as artificial productions; therefore
Wincklers’s experiments, if true, show that they exist in nature,
or, in other words, that they are educts, and not products,
from cod-liver oil. Moreover, the presence of oxide of propyl,
and the absence of oxide of glycyl in cod-liver oil, will enable
chemists to distinguish by tests, with certainty, this oil from
other fatty oils.]—<i>Annals of Pharmacy, June, 1852.</i></p>

<h3>GUARANA.
<span class="hsmall">
COMMUNICATED BY D. RITCHIE, SURGEON, R. N.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>A medicinal substance named guaraná was presented to me
about two years ago by a Brazilian. The virtues which he asserted
that it possessed induced me to employ it as a remedy
in several troublesome and obstinate cases of disease. The
consequent benefit was so decided, that I was
convinced of the <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
great value it possessed as a remedial agent. This conviction,
with the belief that it was still unknown, impelled me to bring
the subject under the notice of the <i>profession</i> in this country.
A short account of it was therefore transmitted to the editor of
the “Edinburgh Monthly Medical Journal,” who forthwith
submitted it to Professor Christison. To the kindness and extensive
acquirements of this gentleman I am indebted for the
information, that the subject had already engaged the attention,
of the brothers Martius in Germany, and several French
writers. It was a matter of satisfaction to me to find that the
opinions I had expressed regarding the great prospective importance
of this substance were fully borne out by all those
who have diligently examined it.</p>

<p>As a knowledge of the properties and uses of guaraná appears
to be still little diffused in this country, I shall consider
that I am performing an acceptable service to the medical profession
in placing before it an abstract of the more important
facts that are known regarding this substance. Public attention
was first directed to it by M. Gassicourt in 1817, (Journal
de Pharmac., tom. iii., p. 259); but the merit of discovering the
source whence it is derived, and of furnishing a more complete
description of it, belongs to Von Martius, in the year 1826,
(Reise, vol. ii., p. 1061, <i>et seq.</i>)</p>

<p>The term guaraná is derived from the name of a tribe of
Indians, who are dispersed between the rivers Parama and Uruguay,
by whom it is very commonly used as a condiment or
medicine. It is, however, more extensively prepared for commercial
purposes by the Mauhés, an Indian tribe in the province
of Tapajoz. It is, according to Martius, prepared from
the seeds of the Paullinia sorbilis, a species belonging to the
natural family Sapindaceæ. The characters of the species
are:—Glabra, caule erecto angulato, foliis pinnatis bijugis,
foliolis oblongis, remote sinuato-obtuse-dentatis, lateralibus basi
rotundatis, extimo basi cuneato, petiolo nudo angnlato, racemis
pubescentibus·erectis, capsulis pyriformibus apteris rostratis,
valvulis intus villosis. The seeds, which ripen in
the month of <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span>
October and November, are collected, taken out of their capsules,
and exposed to the sun, so as to dry the arillus in which
they are enveloped, that it may be more readily rubbed off by
the fingers. They are now thrown upon a stone, or into a
stone mortar, and reduced to powder, to which a little water
is added, or which is exposed to the night dew, and then
formed by kneading into a dough. In this condition it is
mixed with a few of the seeds entire or contused, and divided
into masses, weighing each about a pound, which are rolled
into cylindrical or spherical forms. These are dried by the
sun or by the fire, and become so hard as to be broken with
difficulty. Their surface is uneven, brown, or sometimes
black, from the smoke to which they have been subjected;
their fractured surface is conchoidal, unequal, and resinoid;
color reddish brown, resembling chocolate. This is the guaraná,
and in this condition, or reduced to powder, it is kept for use
or carried to market. The Museum of the Edinburgh College
of Physicians contains a specimen of it in each of these forms.
As it is liable to be adulterated with cocoa or mandioca flour,
it is of great importance to be aware that the genuine article is
distinguished by its greater hardness and density, and that,
when powdered, it does not assume a white color, but a grayish-red
tint.</p>

<p>A chemical analysis of this substance was first made by
Theodore Martius, in 1826, (Buchner’s Repert. de Pharm.
xxxi., 1829, p. 370). He found it to consist of a matter
(tannin?) which iron precipitated green, resin, a fat green oil,
gum, starch, vegetable fibre, and a white, bitter, crystalline
product, to which the efficacy of the medicine was principally
owing, and which he called guaranine. This he believed to be
distinct from, but allied to, theine and caffeine, and to possess
the following elementary constituents:—C<sub>8</sub>,&#x202f;H<sub>10</sub>,&#x202f;O<sub>2</sub>,&#x202f;N<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>Another very careful analysis of guaraná was made in the
year 1840, by MM. Berthemot and Dechastélus, (Journal de
Pharmacie, tom. xxvi., p. 518, <i>et seq.</i>), which varies in some
degree from the preceding. They found
the matter, which <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
was considered to be resin by Martius, a combination of tannin
with guaranine, existing in a form insoluble in water or ether.
They also determined the perfect identity of the crystalline
matter with caffeine. It is found to exist in a much larger
proportion in the fruits of the Paullinia than in any of the
plants from which it has hitherto been extracted. Alcohol is
the only agent which completely removes it from the guaraná.
To this solution the addition of lime or hydrated oxide of lead
gives, on the one hand, the insoluble tannates, and on the
other, the crystalline matter.</p>

<p>The medicinal virtues of this substance have been attentively
examined by Theodore Martius, (Op. cit.), and more particularly
by Dr. Gavrelle (sur une nouvelle substance médicinale,
etc.: Paris, 1840), who employed it very often while in Brazil,
as physician to Don Pedro, and afterwards in France. By
both it is considered a valuable remedy, and an important addition
to the Materia Medica. By the vulgar it is held to be
stomachic, antifebrile, and aphrodisiac; is used in dysentery,
diarrhœa, retention of urine, and various other affections. It
stimulates, and at the same time soothes, the gastric system of
nerves. It reduces the excited sensibility of the cœliac plexus,
thereby diminishing febrile action, and strengthening the
stomach and intestines, particularly restraining excessive mucous
discharges, increasing the action of the heart and the arteries,
and promoting diaphoresis. It is therefore indicated as
a valuable remedy in fevers, or reduced vital power resulting
from cold or prolonged wetness, grief, to great muscular exertion,
depression of spirits, long watching, and also in colic,
flatulence, anorexia, nervous hemicrania, or in a dry condition
of the skin. It is contra-indicated in a plethoric or loaded
condition of the abdominal viscera, and when there exists determination
of blood to the head. It is said to increase the venereal
appetite, but to diminish the fecundating power.</p>

<p>In cases where irritation of the urethra or urinary bladder
succeed venereal or attend organic disease, it exerts a
most salutary effect in soothing the irritability
of the mucous <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
membrane, relieving the nervous prostration which accompanies
these affections, and exalting vital power. Unlike the
disagreeable remedies which are generally, and often without
success, employed in these affections, it is taken with pleasure,
and with an amount of success which, as far as my experience
extends, is universal.</p>

<p>If we examine guaraná according to its chemical characters,
it must be guarded as a most valuable substance, from its possessing
in so great a proportion that important nitrogenous
principle guaranine. This, if not identical with caffeine, is at
least analagous to it, and to theine, and theobromine,—all important
elements of food and grateful stimulents. From its
chemical constitution, then, we may predict with great certainty
its physiological action being powerfully tonic; but in the combination
in which it is found, experience indicates that it possesses
conjoined more valuable properties than belong to the
simple tonics. Its power of correcting generally the discharges,
and restoring the normal vitality of the mucous membranes,
must be viewed as one of these.</p>

<h3>COLORED FIRES FOR PYROTECHNICAL PURPOSES.</h3>

<p>Erdmann, in the last number of his journal, gives the following
formulæ for preparing colored fires, which he has proved
and found to answer the purpose intended admirably. He
particularly enjoins the caution that the ingredients, after being
powdered in a mortar <i>separately</i>, should be mixed with the
hand, as dangerous explosions would inevitably follow from the
ingredients being rubbed together with any hard substance.</p>

<h3>EXTRACTUM LOBELIÆ FLUIDUM.
<span class="hsmall">
BY WILLIAM PROCTER, JR.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Having had occasion to prepare a fluid extract of lobelia at
the solicitation of a druggist, the following process was employed,
which is based on the fact, that in the presence of an
excess of acid, the lobelina of the natural salt which gives activity
to the drug, is not decomposed and destroyed by the heat
used, as explained on a former occasion, (vol. xix. page
108 of this Journal.)</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Macerate the lobelia in a pint and a half of the diluted alcohol,
previously mixed with the acetic acid, for twenty-four hours;
introduce the mixture into an earthen displacer, pour on slowly
the remainder of the diluted alcohol, and afterwards water until
three pints of tincture are obtained; evaporate this in a
water bath to ten fluid ounces, strain, add the alcohol and,
when mixed, filter through paper.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Each teaspoonful of this preparation is equal to half a fluid
ounce of the tincture. It may be employed advantageously to
make a syrup of lobelia, by adding two fluid ounces of the fluid
extract, to ten fluid ounces of simple syrup, and mixing. Syrup
of lobelia is an eligible preparation for prescription use, in cases
where lobelia is indicated as an expectorant.—<i>American Journal

<h3>NEW METHOD FOR PREPARING AND EXHIBITING
PROTIODIDE OF IRON.
<span class="hsmall">
BY M. H. BONNEWYN.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Several methods have been proposed for the preparation and
exhibition of protiodide of iron, all of which are, as far as I
am acquainted with them, subject to many inconveniences and
objections. It is on this account that I offer to my fellow-laborers
a new method, which both on account of its uniformity
of action and facility of ad­min­i­stra­tion, deserves to be
adopted universally.</p>

<p>Every practical man knows that all preparations of protiodide
of iron are bad, for instance, syrupus ferri iodidi is a
medicine which is generally disliked, and in some individuals
causes nausea and even vomiting. The
pilulæ ferri iodidi <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
likewise disagree with some constitutions, and when they seem
to agree, they never produce the same regular effects even if
prepared at the same labratory. According to trials made by
an experienced physician, who has administered the protiodide,
prepared according to my method, I am assured that this remedy
prepared by a double decomposition in the stomachs of the
patients, has always agreed with them, and produced more
constant and salutary effects. It is already a well-known fact,
that the iodide of iron in its incipient state is better assimilated
by the organs.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">No. 1.</span>
Dissolve one gramme of iodide potassium in 300
grammes of water.
<span class="nowrap">No. 2.</span> Take sulphate of iron
<span class="nowrap">1&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
grammes;
make a powder and divide into eighteen equal parts. Dissolve
one of the powders in a large table-spoonful of sugared
water before swallowing it; take immediately afterwars, one
table-spoonful of the solution.</p>

<p>It is evident that by this operation, each time their is produced
in the stomach one grain, or about five centigrammes of
iodide of iron in its incipient state.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Although these proportions do not correspond absolutely, but
only approximately with their chemical equivalents, nevertheless,
their effects answer fully the purposes both of the chemist,
and Physician.—<i>Annals of Pharmacy and Practical Chemistry.</i></p>

however, to change the time of meeting, were there any authority by which such
change could be made. In view of the importance of the object, we hope that

many of our Druggists and Chemists as possible, I deem it proper to suggest
that not only all regularly incorporated and unincorporated associations of this
kind should see that they are fully represented, but that where no associations
exist as yet, the apothecaries should send one or more of their number as delegates
to the convention,—such will, no doubt, be cheerfully admitted to seats in
the convention.</p>

subjoin:―</div>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">C<b>OMMENTS</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">ON</span>
<span class="smmaj">“COMMENTS.”</span>—The American Journal of Pharmacy (Philadelphia),
for July, contains “Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal notices, being extracts from various articles
in the New York Journal of Pharmacy, with comments by the
editor,” in which <span class="xxpn" id="p253">{253}</span>
our friend Procter, criticises, rather severely, some of the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal formulæ
and suggestions that have been offered in this Journal. With full respect for the
great acquirements and high character as a practical pharmaceutist, to which
my friend Procter is justly entitled, I should have been glad if the articles, upon
which he comments, had met his approval; and I know of no one that I would
rather should set me right, if anything that I have offered does not find acceptance
with him. With the greater part of his comments, I do not think there
is occasion for controversy,—matters of fact readers can judge for themselves,
and it certainly is of little consequence, who may be found in error, compared
with the elucidation of truth.</p>

<p class="padtopc">In respect to the <i>consistence</i> of Syrup of Gum Arabic, he is probably nearer
right, (during this hot weather, at any rate) than I was, and still, I think he is not
right. My experience with the present officinal formula, had been in the cold
season, when I found the syrup decidedly too thick for convenient use, especially
by itself; a large proportion of it crystallized in the temperature of the
shop, and the mouth and neck of the bottle choked up with candied syrup every
two or three times it was used. I had found the former syrup to answer very
well in regard to consistence and flavor, though, it certainly could not be considered
permanent; it had to be made in small quantities and frequently; indeed, I
do not suppose that any liquid combination of gum, sugar and water only, can be
made of a permanent character. Since reading Mr. Procter’s comments, I have
made this syrup again by the present formula, and it does keep decidedly better at
this season, than that made in the other proportions, yet not perfectly; and there
is considerable cry­stal­li­za­tion, even in the very hot weather we have had lately.
I infer that syrup which crystallizes at this season, has an excess of sugar in it, the
crystals formed tending further to reduce the remaining syrup, and thus sooner
promote acidity than if a proportion of sugar had been used which could remain
in solution. Perhaps, a medium between the two formulæ could be hit upon, in
which the proper balance might be better attained.</p>

<p class="padtopc">In the formula offered for Compound Syrup of Squill, in our Journal for April,
there is an error of four ounces in the quantity of honey, which should have been
<i>twenty-two</i> ounces. Whether it was made by the printer or not cannot be ascertained,
as “the <i>copy</i> has been destroyed.” I had not noticed it until my attention
was called to it by Mr. Procter’s comments. The quantity of sugar
used by me in making this syrup was, for convenience, one pound avoirdupois
weight; that of honey, one pound and a half, same weight. In transcribing the formula
for a medical Journal, I thought I must, per custom, render it in troy weights;
so as <span class="nowrap">15 oz.</span>
troy are 200 grs. more than one pound av., I set down
<span class="nowrap">15 oz.,</span> and
intended to set down <span class="nowrap">22 oz.</span>
of honey, as being only 60 grs. more than one
pound and a half av. I think this addition of <span class="nowrap">4 oz.</span>
of honey will make the whole
come up to Mr. Procter’s measure of “56 fluid ounces before the ebullition,” &amp;c.,
and a little over. The boiling can be continued only for a few minutes. I was
formerly in the practice of boiling to three pints, and adding 48 grs. tartar emetic,
but finding that I had to evaporate more than half a pint,
and judging that <span class="xxpn" id="p254">{254}</span>
the strength of the resulting preparation was rather lessened than increased
thereby, I concluded to stop at three and a half pints. As to the proportion of sugar
and honey, they amount together to
<span class="nowrap">2&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub></span>
pounds av., which with two pints of an evaporated
menstruum, containing the extractive matter soluble in diluted alcohol
of <span class="nowrap">8 oz.</span>
of the roots, furnishes a syrup of good consistence. It may be observed,
that solution of sugar in a menstruum so charged, is quite different from that
in water. Perhaps, however, an equal amount of sugar with that of the
honey, would be preferable. I can only say, that I employed the same
quantity a number of times, but reduced it several years since, because it appeared
to be too much for some reason, the particulars of which I do not recollect.
And as this formula has always given me a satisfactory preparation, I have
thought no more about it, until now. Or perhaps, it would be better to continue
the evaporation to three pints, with the advantage of producing a more symmetrical
result, corresponding, at the same time, with the quantity of the Pharmacopœia.
But, is not the officinal formula “almost as far out of the way” the <i>other</i>
way? Forty-two oz. of sugar in forty-eight fluid oz. of syrup! Can such an
amount remain in solution twenty-four hours at any ordinary temperature? If
mine is an “<i>anomaly</i>,” is not this an <i>impossibility</i>, “in point of consistence”? In
reference to the alcoholic objection, it may be remarked, that the evaporation in
the case commented upon, is not “from 4 pints of tincture to 2 pints,” but from
<span class="nowrap">4&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>4</sub></span>
pints to 2 pints. The small portion of alcohol, that may remain after
this evaporation and the continued heat to the end of the process, can
scarcely be of serious consequence in the doses in which it is prescribed; it may
have some influence in preserving the syrup, and also in promoting its medical
action. Be all this as it may, so far as taste is a criterion, this preparation appears to
be of at least double strength in the qualities of both roots, of the officinal syrup
carefully made by the second process given,—the first being, as I suppose, with
all apothecaries of the present day, “an obsolete idea.”</p>

adds, “the objection to the officinal formula on the score of color, is hardly
valid, and if it was so, it would be better to color it with extract of grass,
than to substitute a preparation which will constantly vary in strength and
appearance or with the age of the leaves. The officinal extract of stramonium,
is easily incorporated with lard, and produces a brown colored ointment
of comparatively uniform strength.” We do not pretend to have furnished
a formula vastly superior to that received in our officinal guide. But
as we were writing for our locality chiefly, and knowing
the general expectation <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
and usage of furnishing stramonium ointment of a green color, we have given
a formula which does furnish an ointment having a proper strength, requisite
color, without the loss of time and material necessarily incurred in manufacturing
a color ad hoc as suggested by W. Procter, Jr., which from the contamination
of the decomposed chlorophylle of the extract, would never compare
favorably (not­with­stand­ing all that useless waste of trouble,) so far as its
appearance is concerned, with the far readier mode proposed for transforming at
once by a few short manipulations the dry stramonium into an alcoholic extract and
ointment without liability to alteration during the process. Respecting the keeping
of both ointments, we can affirm that the one prepared by the modified formula,
will keep as well if not better and longer, than the other, and as the color
is a point of some importance for our public and practitioners, we are satisfied
that it will be preferred on the score of economy of time as well as for its color,
which is desirable at least within our circle of custom.</p>

objects to the addition of acetic acid to the officinal blistering cerate, and
seems to smile at the idea of fixing by it the volatile principle of the cantharis,
which, by the way, he gratuitously makes the author to say is a neutral
substance, when he says not a word about it. He quotes the authority
of Mr. Redwood, who in the Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal, October, 1841, speaks
of acetic acid as not being a good solvent for cantharidine. The reason is, in
all probability, from the fact of his using the London standard strength, which
is but 1.48. For Messrs. Lavini and Sobrero, (Memoire lu a l’academie des
sciences de Turin, 9 Mars, 1845,) state that “concentrated acetic acid,, dissolves
cantharidine, but more readily under the influence of heat.” Respecting
the volatility of cantharidine, these same chemists have stated in the same paper
“that while manipulating with but 52 grammes of flies, for the researches they
were making on cantharidine, one of them suffered from blisters produced on the
face and lips, by the emanations from these insects.” Besides their authority,
Soubeiran, in his Traite de Pharmacie, and Dorvault in the Officine, both state that
cantharidine is a very volatile substance, even at ordinary temperature, and if
that is, as it appears to be, the ease, what reliable information have we that only
1-30th of a grain was volatilized in the experiment mentioned by W. Procter, Jr.,
made with 100 grs. of powdered cantharides? Is it not very probable, that in
removing the hygrometric water, much more was lost?</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Whatever may be the changes which take place by the addition of acetic acid
in a concentrated state, it is a fact, proved by experience, that the blistering plaster
thus prepared, keeps better—that is, retains its power longer than the officinal
one even exposed to the air in thin layers. As an example of the stability of this
combination, we have <i>Brown’s Cantharidine</i> which, to all appearance, is made
from an etherial extract of cantharides additioned with concentrated acetic acid
and incorporated in melted wax. We find such a mixture, although spread on
paper and but imperfectly protected from the air, retaining for a long period
its vesicating properties. Is this advantage produced by
a simple acid <span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
saponification of the cerate, without reaction on the active principle, but that of protecting
it from atmospheric influences? We think it probable that there is a
modification taking place, both on the cantharis and other components of the
cerate.</p>

<h3>ON THE OIL OF GRAIN SPIRIT, OR FUSEL OIL.
<span class="hsmall">
BY EDWARD N. KENT.</span></h3>

<p>The oil of grain spirit, has recently attracted considerable
attention from the fact of its being the basis of a
number of artificial perfumes or essences, one of which
has been extensively used under the name of banana or pear
essence.</p>

<p>The crude oil, as is well known, consists principally of
hydrated oxide of amyl, mixed with more or less alcohol, and
small quantities of other substances, the nature of which is not
generally known, though it has been asserted that œnanthic
ether and œnanthic acid may be found among them. To
obtain the latter articles was a desired object, and that which
led to the subject of this paper.</p>

<p>Crude fusel oil, (or oil of grain spirit) when distilled in
a glass retort, commences to pass over at about 190° Fahrenheit,
and a considerable portion is obtained below 212; which consists
mostly of alcohol and water, with a small quantity of the
hydrated oxide of amyl. By changing the receiver and continuing
the operation to about 280°, a large product is obtained,
consisting principally of hydrated oxide of amyl, but contaminated
with a little alcohol and water, and a trace of less
volatile oil, which may be found in larger quantity in the
residue remaining in the retort. This residue is small, of an
agreeable odor, and consists of
several substances among <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span>
which may be found, an oil having the intoxicating smell, but
not the chemical properties of œnanthic ether, other than a
similarity in its boiling point.</p>

<p>To obtain a more perfect separation of the substances contained
in the crude oil, a small copper still was constructed, on
the principal which is now so successfully used in the manufacture
of high proof alcohol, and which proved highly useful for
the above purpose. This still is so arranged, that the vapor
which is evolved by the boiling liquid, passes through a series
of bent tubes, each of which is connected with a return pipe
for returning vapors less volatile than boiling water, back to
the still. These tubes are enclosed in a copper funnel filled
with cold water, which becomes heated as the operation proceeds,
and finally boils; the less volatile vapors are thus
prevented from passing over, and the alcohol and water are
almost perfectly separated from the oil remaining in the still.—If
the water is then drawn off from the vessel containing the
serpentine tube, the distillation may be continued till it ceases
spontaneously.</p>

<p>The product thus obtained, when rectified from a little
dry caustic potash to remove coloring matter and acetic and
valerianic acid, and again rectified from dry quick lime to
remove water, gives pure hydrated oxide of amyl.</p>

<p>The residue left in the copper still is most easily obtained by
distillation with water, containing a little carbonate of soda to
neutralise the free acids contained in it. A small quantity of
a yellow oil is thus obtained, having an agreeable vinous odor
similar to œnanthic ether, but unlike that ether it yields fusel
oil, instead of alcohol, when distilled repeatedly from caustic
potash. It is consequently an <i>amyl</i> compound, while œnanthic
ether is known to be the œnanthate of oxide of <i>ethyle</i>.</p>

<p>The residue remaining in the still after the above distillation
with water, consists of acetic and valerianic acids in combination
with the soda, and the solution holds in suspension a considerable
quantity of byrated oxide of iron, which formerly
existed in combination
with the acids. <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span></p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>From the above statement it appears that crude fusel oil
contains the following substances, viz:―</p>

<div><ul class="ulstnz">
<li>Alcohol,</li>
<li>Water,</li>
<li>Hydrated oxide of amyl,</li>
<li>Acetic acid,</li>
<li>Valerianic acid,</li>
<li>Oxide of iron.</li></ul></div>

<p class="pcontinue">And an amyl compound, analagous to œnanthic ether.</p>

<h3>EASY METHOD TO MAKE HYPOSULPHITE OF SODA.
<span class="hsmall">
BY JOHN C. TALLON.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Happening to inquire the price of hyposulphite of soda of a
wholesale druggist, it appeared to me that the cost of its production
is <i>greatly</i> under the wholesale price, I therefore
suggest to apothecaries who may wish to make it <i>pure</i>, for their
own consumption, the following: Through a saturated solution
of sal soda (ascertained to be free from sulphate) pass sulphurous
acid gas until a small quantity, taken out of the solution
after agitation, on the end of a glass rod, gives a white
precipitate with nitrate of silver; then put the solution into a
beaker glass, and boil it with sulphur (about one-twentieth of
the weight of the soda in solution) until a little of the liquid,
put into a test glass, gives, with a few drops of hydrochloric
acid, a precipitate of sulphur, and another portion with nitrate
of silver a white precipitate, immediately turning yellow and
then black, when the liquid is to be filtered and evaporated
quickly, until the salt be crystallized quite dry. The crystals
are to be put into a closely stopped bottle, and kept well secured
from the atmosphere. The advantage of this process over
the common one is that it can be made in the store without any
annoyance from the stench of melted sulphur; it costs but little
and does not require the <i>continued</i> attention of the operator.</p>

<h3>NOTES IN PHARMACY, No. 4.

<div class="divh4ord"><h4 class="h4runin">
<span class="smcap">T<b>INCTURA</b></span>
<span class="smcap">B<b>ESTUSCHEFFI.</b></span></h4>—In the last number (8) of this Journal,
Mr. Mayer, speaking of this preparation, says that the formula
given by me in the May number, is the “oldest” from
“the Austrian Pharmacopœia of 1820,” and suggests, as an
improvement, preparing the salt by passing through a solution
of protochlor. ferri, a current of chlorine, to the proper point
of saturation. The formula I gave <i>is</i> the “oldest” and the
<i>original</i>, for which reason I selected it, affording as it does <i>the</i>
“Bestuscheff’s tincture,” at one time so highly valued, and
though I did not consider it very creditable to the scientific accuracy
of its “fatherland,” it is the one which “did the good.”
The advantages, seemingly, claimed by Mr. Mayer for his process,
is its affording a more certain preparation. This does
not appear evident, as the resulting tincture will be the same,
respectively, by whatever process, supposing equal care to be
used in conducting it. It may be possible that a stronger solution
is obtained, but that is not asserted, nor is it important,
as that would concern the <i>dose</i>, not the effect of the medicine.
The difference, aside from the identity of the preparation,
appears to me to be that, in one case experiment will be
necessary to ascertain the strength of the tincture, whilst in the
other it can be determined more quickly by calculation, but the
extra labor required in the process in the later case, more than
counterbalances any superiority there may be in this respect.
I have, however, no objection to make to Mr. Mayer’s process,
which is a very <i>neat</i> way of making “Ethereal Tincture
of Sesquichloride of Iron”; but, I think, those who desire to
make “Bestuscheff’s Tincture,” will consider it more strictly
accurate to adhere to the “oldest formula.”</div>

<div class="divh4ord"><h4 class="h4runin">
<span class="smcap">D<b>ECOMPOSED</b></span>
<span class="smcap">C<b>HLOROFORM.</b></span></h4>—A specimen of this article lately
came into my possession, to which, I think it right to direct the
attention of apothecaries, although, its villainous
odor was so <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span>
disagreeable and suffocating, as to render it almost impossible
that it could be administered, still it may serve to teach the
necessity of all those having to do with the article, exercising
such increased care that so bad an article could not pass through
their hands unnoticed; for what might be the consequences in
such a case if the sensible properties of the article did not happen
to be so repugnant? And as it is desirable, in a scientific
point of view, to know everything about so important an agent,
it is proper and necessary that anything unusual in its regard
should be recorded. The article in question, was contained in
a badly stopped bottle, and had leaked one-eighth of its quantity.
On removing the cupping, an efflorescent crust was observed
coating the upper surface of the lip of the bottle and
contiguous stopper, of a whitish, partly yellowish-green appearance,
having a caustic taste, and washing off readily with water
but not with chloroform, and precipitating nitrate of silver; the
precipitate being soluble in ammonia and not in nitric acid,
leading me to infer from this and other circumstances, that this
substance was, probably a hydrochlorate of ammonia. The neck
of the bottle before the stopper was removed, presented a yellowish
appearance from some colored substance being interposed
between it and the stopper, a pretty constant accompaniment of
this kind of decomposition, which should always be noted. On
removing the stopper, fumes escaped having a most suffocating
odor, causing the bottle to be withdrawn quickly from the nostril
and giving with ammonia, the white fumes char­ac­ter­is­tic of hydrochloric
acid gas. By exposure the peculiar odor disappeared,
and the whole of the liquid passed off without leaving any residue,
except a slight greasy appearance on the sides of the glass
from which it was evaporated, which <i>was not</i> owing to sulphuric
acid. The specific gravity was that of good chloroform, and
sulphuric acid acquired no color when agitated with a portion,
and the reaction with litmus was strongly acid. The bottle
having been emptied, the small portion which adhered to the
glass, collecting in the bottom, assumed a yellowish appearance
resembling common muriatic acid. Not
having leisure or <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span>
means to make an elaborate examination, I handed some to one
of our professors of chemistry, who will make an accurate
analysis. In the meantime, I deemed it prudent to note these
particulars. A large quantity of the article, made at the same
time and by the same process, I have since learned, has been
found to have undergone a similar change. The manufacturer,
supposes the decomposition to have arisen in some way from
the sulphuric acid used in the process after the manner of
Professor Gregory, although every means was used to separate
it and none could be detected in it when recently made;
some, however, which was thus supposed to be free from
acid, I found to slightly redden litmus, although the smell was
remarkably fine; but it has been found I learn, that of two specimens
of the article taken from the same bottle and <i>exposed to
the light</i>, one underwent decomposition and the other not.
It has occurred to me, that the surest way of separating the
acid would be to distil the chloroform from it; but it should be
remembered that the process of Gregory, was intended to be
adopted for smaller quantities for immediate use, and not for
its manufacture on a large scale, to be kept.</div>

<div class="divh4ord"><h4 class="h4runin">
<span class="smcap">S<b>UPPOSITORIA.</b></span></h4>—In
the number of the <i>New York Medical
Times</i> for December, 1851, I took occasion to mention the superiority
of cacao butter, to the other excipients for the formation of
suppositories, a means of medication which had <i>become almost
obsolete</i>; not unlikely from the circumstance of their having been
prepared with iritating substances which counteracted their intended
effect. In the last (July) number of the <i>American Journal
of Pharmacy</i>, (Philadelphia,) Mr. A. B. Taylor, (who has
not, apparently, seen my little note,) gives several formulas for
these, which require the cacao butter to be melted, in which
state the medicament is incorporated with it, &amp;c. I recur to
the subject for the purpose of stating that I have not found it
necessary to adopt this very troublesome and tedious, not to
say inaccurate method. The article, at all seasons, becomes
sufficiently plastic when “worked” in the mortar, or in very
cold weather, with the addition of a drop or so
of almond or <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
other proper oil, to admit of being <i>rolled</i> with the spatula into
form, the most convenient one for which I have found to be
that of a cylinder about an inch long, weighing twenty grains,
and fitting exactly the calibre of the instrument used for introducing
them, which I generally use as a mould. The active
ingredients used are mostly sulph. morph. and extr. opii
aquos. the latter of which is superior to opium, of course, being
<i>nearly</i> free from narcotine. <i>Vaginal suppositories</i> would be
equally applicable and useful as anal ones.</div>

<span class="smcap">J<b>OURNAL</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>HARMACY.</b></span></h4>—Professor Proctor
has done me the honor to notice, favorably, some trifles
which I have found time to contribute to our Journal, among
others an observation concerning the supposed decomposition
of Fowler’s solution, with respect to which he says he “does
not understand where the garlicky odor came from, as it is only
the <i>vapor</i> of metallic arsenic that possesses this peculiarity.”
I beg to assure the Professor that the odor <i>came from the bottle</i>.
The immediate cause of it is certainly <i>mist</i>-erious, though
it is not impossible that among the intricacies of chemical action
sufficient heat may have been evolved to act on how small
soever a portion of the metal in a <i>nascent state</i> as to cause the
peculiar odor. <i>Spontaneous combustion</i> taking place in a
mass of the common mineral known as “cobalt,” produces, unmistakeably,
both vapor and the odor of arsenic, and I have
heard of a ships’ crew having been salivated by the vapor
arising from a cargo of quicksilver in a high latitude. A very
much lower degree of heat is required to produce vapor
than might be supposed from the point of volatility of the substance
whence it emanates, an instance in point being the
familiar process of boiling water; but this is rather a <i>cloudy
point</i> which would require the acumen of a certain celebrated
jury to elucidate, and to their tender mercies it is perhaps the
better part to consign it.</div>

<h3>GENERAL
REPORT UPON THE RESULTS AND EFFECTS OF THE “DRUG LAW,” MADE TO
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.
<span class="hsmall">
BY C. B. GUTHRIE, M. D.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The act of Congress, approved 26th of June, 1848, entitled
“an Act to prevent the importation of spurious and adulterated
drugs and medicines,” having now been in existence and
enforcement almost three years, the working of the law and its
effects, immediate and remote, have become necessarily matters
of fact, and are no longer left to conjecture and speculation.</p>

<p>At the time of the passage of this law by congress, no inconsiderable
fears were entertained by its friends, and great hopes
by its enemies, that it would be found impracticable to carry
out its requisite provisions without great injury to that portion
of our citizens engaged in the importation of this class of merchandize,
in which event its repeal would, of course, have
been urgently solicited.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn23" id="fnanch23">23</a></p>

<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch23" id="fn23">23</a>
Strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the popularity of this
law may be found in this significant fact that not a petition for its
repeal has ever been presented to Congress.</p></div>

<p>In entering upon the duties of the commission, which I had
the honor to recieve from the department, I was fully impressed
with the importance of the information sought for, and the
necessity of a candid, impartial and unbiassed examination of
facts bearing upon the subject, and in making, to the department,
this report, I have divided my results and facts into immediate
and remote; the reasons for which, will appear in the
detail. Under the general terms drugs and medicines, are embraced
all articles intended for the treatment of the diseases of
the human system, and though they admit of many subdivisions,
these terms, included under the two heads of chemicals and
compounds, and crude drugs, are all that
is necessary for my <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
purpose in speaking of the effects and applications of the law.</p>

<p>First, with regard to the effect upon chemicals and compound
medicines.: Previous to the passage of this law, no restriction
was laid upon any class of medicines coming in under
this head. If the importer paid the requisite duty, no questions
were asked, no limit was fixed as to quality or condition.
It needs no argument, but merely a mention of the fact, to
show that any compound medicine or chemical preparation
may be so made as to deceive the unsuspecting and uneducated,
and even very often the druggist, apothecary, physician,
and all, because they were not in the habit of analysing their
articles, and were deceived by their external, often times very
fine appearance. Under the combined influence of competition
and avarice—two strong temptations, the manufacture of
articles of this class had become systematised, and on purpose
to supply the United States market.</p>

<p>The immediate and positive beneficial results of the law
may be seen in the fact that now very few, if indeed any,
spurious or sophisticated chemical preparations, for phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal
purposes, are even offered at our ports, or by any possibility
find their way into our markets. Manufacturing chemists
and importers of this description of medicines, finding it
impossible to get such goods through our custom houses, will,
of course, not risk the loss of bringing them here, but in their
stead will import such as are known to come up to our required
standards. Under this general head of chemicals, may be included
a large majority of the manufactured and compound
medicines used in practice by the medical faculty, and all the
most important usually purchased by others for domestic uses,
more especially in the great west and south, where every man,
almost, is obliged to learn the uses and doses of calomel,
blue mass and quinine, &amp;c. The certainty of purity in these
articles alone, is a matter of no small moment to the community
at large; of the probabilities of their home adulteration I
shall also refer to elsewhere.</p>

<p>A few articles of this class may now and
then, either through <span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
culpable negligence on the part of the inspector, or by being entered
under a false name, be imported, but they must be few, and
are daily growing less. An instance of this kind has occurred in
New York, where a large lot of sulphate of lime was offered in
market, under the name of precipitated chalk. The New York
College of Pharmacy, standing very properly as the guardians
of the public health, and protectors of this act, for which they
had petitioned and which they had agreed to support, by committee,
reported the fact, and warned the holders of the consequences
of continuing to sell the article as a medicinal preparation,
upon which they very readily withdrew it. How it came
into the city that committee have never been able to ascertain,
whether imported under the head of plaster of Paris, and thus
escaping the eye of the inspector, or whether passed by him,
or at some other port, without due test and examination, I am
not able to say. That it was imported under a false name, is,
to my mind, the most likely of all.</p>

<p>If our Colleges of Pharmacy in the different cities, as I have
no doubt they will, continue to thus watch the articles offered
them and the public, and act with the independence that has
characterised them thus far, no deception of this kind will go
long unexposed, and it will soon cease altogether.</p>

<p>No manufactured article, susceptible of adulteration, ought
ever to be suffered to pass by the Examiner of drugs without
being <i>sampled</i> and tested by analysis, and no matter what its
appearances, or what its label; neither the one or the other
are guarantees of its purity, for both may alike be counterfeits.
The more popular the maker, the higher his name and reputation,
the more likely his name, label, bottle and article to be
counterfeited, as has Pelletier’s name to the article quinine,
others to iodide of potassium, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Secondly. The effects of the law upon crude drugs and
medicines, such as leaves, barks, roots, gums, gum resins, &amp;c.
Upon these articles, the effect has been the same as upon
chemicals and compound goods. Greater variations must of,
course occur in their qualities, as many of
them cannot be <span class="xxpn" id="p267">{267}</span>
tested with accuracy; and of the rest, very imperfect standards
are to be found in any of the works on pharmacy or materia
medica now extant. This was heretofore left entirely in the
hands of the examiner at each port, who has been obliged to
fix his own standards when there were none laid down in the
works referred to in the instructions of the department. Such
has been the case with many of our most valuable and important
articles of crude drugs, gums, and gum resins,—such as
opium, scammony, &amp;c. Such also has been the case with many
of the roots and barks, as rhubarb and the cinchona and all
its varieties. One may have fixed upon five per cent. of morphine,
and another upon eight, another ten, as the standard
for opium. Again, the same might occur in admitting or rejecting
scammony. One requiring sixty or seventy per cent. of
resin, another admitting or rejecting, merely from the physical
appearance of the article.</p>

<p>So again with regard to barks, especially the cinchonas—one
refusing to admit any except the true medicinal article;
another admitting Maricaibo and other false barks usually sold
in market as pale bark, or used to adulterate that article.—But,
upon the whole class of crude drugs, the effect has been
highly beneficial. Greater care is taken in their selection
and preparation for market, and a vast quantity of many
kinds of barks and roots heretofore finding daily their way
into market either in their simple worthlessness or mixed
with purer and different articles, are now scarcely, if ever
found; and if seen, they are about the last of their kind.—Now
and then, an article may get through our ports, by
some adroit means of deception, or be slipped in at a port
where there is no examiner, but this must be but seldom.—But
recently, in New York, I saw several casks of gum
guaic, the heads of which, for about six inches, were filled with
a fair article, while the remaining portion of the cask was
made up of the vilest trash imaginable. This is but a shallow
trick that could not be often repeated, for though it might decieve
the examiner (as it did not), it would
meet detection in <span class="xxpn" id="p268">{268}</span>
the hands of the jobber, who would not fail to claim damages
from the importer at once. Another mode of evading the law,
is by sending sample packages to the examining office, or such
cases as are known to be all right, and getting the whole invoice
passed by them. This can only be guarded against by
the examiner being always upon the alert, and where there is
the least doubt, refusing to pass anything except what he sees and
knows to be correct as to quality. The facility with which this
fraud may be practised, led the convention of the Colleges of
Pharmacy to recommend that every package should be examined;
an opinion, I then and now fully concur in. Many similar instances,
both in regard to chemicals, chemical preparations and
all sorts of crude drugs, might be given, but they have no bearing
upon the object of this report, only as they point to a
necessity for the law’s continuance.</p>

<p>Another immediate result of the law is the exclusion of damaged
drugs. Heretofore no state of damage or decay, whether
little or much, prevented an article, either manufactured or
crude, being thrown into market and sold for whatever it purported
to be, whether calomel half oxydyzed, iodide of potassium
one-third deliquesced, rhubarb one-half rotten, senna in a similar
or worse condition from being soaked with salt water—they
each sold under their original names, and found their way into
the bands of the buyers of <i>cheap goods</i>, either in that state or
powdered or re-bottled, re-labelled, and done up good as new.
The importer got his drawback of twenty-five, fifty, and seventy
per cent. of duty. The insurance company sold the goods and
paid the difference; bargain getters purchased; the physician
prescribed; the apothecary dealt out, and the patient, suffering
under the pains and ills of lingering disease, swallowed; all
but the last got their pay, while the poor man who bore the
unrighteous accumulation of the whole, cursed his physician
for not understanding his complaint, and perchance turned his
face to the wall and died. This is no fancy sketch, but true,
every word of it, and more than once acted out in the dream
of every-day life. <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span></p>

<p>Under the proper construction and ad­min­i­stra­tion of the law,
all this will and is now mostly prevented. It must be evident
that any article of medicine essentially damaged, is not fit to be
given to the sick as a remedy. This is a very important point,
and all examiners should be careful to enforce it strictly, regardless
of the specious plea of interested insurance companies
or individuals, for any other construction for their general
or especial benefit or relief.</p>

<p>In few words then, may be summed up the immediate effects
of this law: A purer and better class of chemicals and compound
preparations, a material improvement in the quality of
crude drugs imported, such as gums, barks, roots, leaves, and
an almost entire exclusion of damaged and decayed drugs from
our markets.</p>

<p>These results are, in themselves, sufficient to mark the law
as one of great value, and to entitle it to a sure claim for perpetuity,
and its provisions to a steady enforcement. But they
are by no means all that it has accomplished. Its remote or
secondary effects, which I propose to point out, are equally important,
and they are found in the influence upon our home
manufactures and trade.</p>

<p>It has often been claimed that the law was a tariff for
protection to home adulteration, and while we shut out the evil
in one way, we were equally exposed to it in the shape of home
preparations; were this even true, it is no argument against the
law for keeping out foreign adulteration, as it is very evident
that if both are equally bad, no pure medicine can be had by
those who require them, while if we are certain the foreign are
pure, we have a choice between the pure and the sophisticated.
But I am satisfied that the amount of home adulterations have
been over estimated, and that under the effect of this law they
are decreasing daily, and perhaps mainly because the demand
is decreasing.</p>

<p>I have never believed, though it has been again and again
asserted, that our medical gentleman to any great extent, who
buy and use most largely of this class of
goods, have desired <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span>
to buy and use inferior medicines, because they were cheap,
and my own direct intercourse and observation, as a druggist
for five years, aside from a six years’ experience in the profession,
has satisfied me of the correctness of my views. I speak
of the country at large. Wherever it has been the case, it has
been the result of ignorance, as to the appearance and physical
properties of drugs that has led them into this error, an error
in which, from a like ignorance, they have been kept by their
druggist, who has been imposed upon by the bland assurance
of the importer or jobber, which led him to take all things
of a like name as of the same quality. There are those who
buy because cheap, and prescribe, and perchance hope for success
in the use of such remedies, but they are not found among
our medical gentlemen of education and character and entitled
to the respect and confidence of the community at large. The
flood of light thrown upon this subject of adulterations of medicines
by the reports to Congress; by the report of Dr. Bailey,
special examiner for the port of New York; reports to the
American Medical Association, and by various other writers in
our phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal and medical journals, through the newspapers
of the day, and various other means to the people, has
worked, and is working a revolution in the drug trade at large.
By a desire and growing necessity for a proper education of phar­ma­ceu­tists
and druggists, a man is no longer considered competent
to sell, dispose and deal out medicinal articles affecting
the health, life and happiness of his fellow-beings, simply because
he can calculate a per centage, or make a profit.</p>

<p>The reform in this department is, I know, but just beginning,
though long needed, but it will progress, for public opinion demands,
and will continue to demand it.</p>

<p>Physicians, professors of materia medica, and teachers of
practical pharmacy and chemistry are feeling it, and the whole
course of teaching upon this and kindred branches, has received
more attention from both professor and pupil within the two
past years, than ever before in the same length of time in the
United States. From these combined sources
will continue to <span class="xxpn" id="p271">{271}</span>
flow a light that must shine upon and enlighten that ignorance
which was permitting men to tamper with the life and health
of the community. This has also had the effect to create a demand
for pure medicines. Rhubarb is no longer rhubarb unless
the quality is such as to commend it to the unfortunate
consumer, and calling a thing by a good name is no longer
sufficient to redeem it from its lack of curative properties and
consequent worthlessness.</p>

<p>Again, the endeavor to come up to the law’s standard for
chemicals, the competition with the imported article, the increasing
demand for good medicines, together with a commendable
emulation among our chemists, has produced an improvement
in this class of goods, sufficiently visible to refute all
charges of home adulteration because protected from foreign
competition; besides this, they are our fellow citizens,
within reach of our complaints, with no intermediate dealer to
shift the blame of impurity to the other side of the ocean, and
thus wash his innocent hands at our cost. With this and the
spirit of inquiry as to what we are selling, what we are buying,
what we are administering, what we are swallowing with hopes
of relief, that is abroad, no man can long escape detection,
exposure and consequent loss of business, if engaged in the
manufacture or sale of spurious goods.</p>

<p>These opinions are the result of the concurrent testimony of
the different examiners, of various dealers in drugs throughout
the country, from whom I had before and since my appointment
to this commission been in receipt of information, and
are fully borne out by my own extensive observation in almost
every state in the union.</p>

<p>Without inquiring or pointing out the cause, the testimony
to this effect, that the quality Of drugs in general has improved
much within the two past years, is almost universal;
and a style of drugs and chemicals, and of medicinal preparations,
may now be found on sale in our great commercial emporiums,
of a quality and purity never before found, certainly
not in the United States, and I
question if any wherelse. <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span></p>

<p>These are the results of my observations, both as to the remote
and immediate, or special and general effects of the law.
And I feel that the friends of the law have great reason to
congratulate themselves and the community at large, upon the
fullest realizations of their hopes as to the good accruing from
this sanitary measure.</p>

<p>Those who were reaping an iniquitous harvest either through
a desire to do evil for the purposes of gain (if any such there
could have been), or through ignorance of the extent of such
evil, must themselves feel that the law has worked no wrong
to them even though it may have forced them into a different
channel of trade. The only ones from whom we shall hear any
complaints while the law is carefully and judiciously executed,
or from whom we shall hear the plea for “unrestricted commerce,”
and the potency of the great laws of trade as in themselves
sufficient for the protection of life and health, are those
whose prototypes aforetime cried out “Great is Diana of the
Ephesians.”</p>

<p>The value of their opinions may be measured by the sincerity
of their professions, and the weight of their testimony
calculated by the per centage of their gains.</p>

<p>I have pursued my enquiries among drug importers and
jobbers, meeting both friends and enemies of the law, among
retail apothecaries, professional men and their patients, and
my conclusions are that no more popular act, stands upon our
congressional record.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>I have only to add my sincere wish, that it may long stand
as a mark of the enlighted wisdom of the age and nation.</p>

<p class="fsz6 padtopb">The above report is but the general report upon the working of the law.—It

<h3>ON THE MANUFACTURE OF NITRATE OF POTASH (SALTPETRE.)</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Previous to the middle of the seventeenth century, the chief
part of the saltpetre consumed in this country was obtained
from refuse animal matters, as is evident from the following
edict, issued by James I., for the regulation of the “mynes of
salt peter.”—“The King, taking into his consideration the most
necessary and important use of gunpowder, as well for supply
of his own royall navie, and the shippinge of his lovinge subjects,
as otherwise for the strength, safety, and defence of his people
and kingdoms, and how greate a blessinge it is of Almighty
God to this realm, that it naturally yieldeth sufficient mynes of
salt peter for making of gunpowder for defence of ittself, without
anie necessitie to depend uppon the dangerous chargeable
and casuall supply thereof from forraigne parts, hath sett downe
certen orders and constitutions to be from henceforth inviolably
kept and observed, for the better maynteyning of the breed and
increase of salt peter, and the true making of gunpowder.</p>

<p>“Noe person doe from henceforth pave with stone or bricke,
or floare with boarde, anie dove-house or dove-cote, or laie the
same with lyme, sand, gravel, or other thing, whereby the
growthe and increase of the myne of salt peter maie be hindered
or ympaired, but shall suffer the floure or grounde thereof to lye
open with goode and mellowe earth, apt to breede increase of
the myne and salt peter, and so contynue and keep the same.</p>

<p>“That no innkeepers, or others that keep stables for travellers
and passengers, doe use anie deceiptful meanes or devices
whereby to destroy or hinder the growthe of salt peter in those
stables. And that no stables at all be pitched, paved, or
gravelled where the horse feete used to stand, but planked only,
nor be paved, pitched, or gravelled before the plankes next the
mangers, but that both places be kept and maynteyned with
goode and mellowe earth, fitt and apt to breede and increase
the myne of salt peter, and laide with nothinge which may
hurte the same. <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span></p>

<p>“That all and every such person and persons as having had
heretofore had anie dove-house, dove-cote, or stable (which were
then good nurseries for the myne of salt peter) have sithence
carried out the goode moulde from thence, and filled the place
agayne with lyme, sand, gravel, rubbish, or other like stuff, or
paved or floored the same, whereby the growthe of salt peter
myne there hath been decayed and destroyed, shall and doe
within three months next contryve to take up the pavements
and boards agayne, and carrie out the said gravel, lyme, and
offensive stuff from thence, and fill the place agayne with goode
and mellowe earth fitt for the increase of salt peter, three foote
deepe at the least, and so contynue and keepe the same for the
breede of salt peter myne. No person, of anie degree whatsoever,
was to denie or hinder the salt peter man workinge any
earth; nor was anie constable to neglect or to forbeare to furnish
him with convenient carriages necessarie for his worke;
and every justice to whom the salt peter man should address
himself for assistance was at his peril to fail to render it, that
his majesties service might not suffer by his default. And no
one was to give any gratuity or bribe to the salt peter man for
forbearinge or sparinge of anie ground or place which may be
digged or wrought for salt peter.”</p>

<p>To lessen the annoyance to the owners of these dove-cotes and
stable beds of saltpetre, and to promote the comfort of the
pigeons, the saltpetre man was “to dig and carrie away the
earth in such convenient time of the daie, and work it in suche
manner as maie give least disturbance and hurte to the pigeons,
and encrease of their breede, and in the chief tyme of breeding,
that it be not done above two howers in anie one daie, and that
about the middest of the daie, when the pigeons use to be
abroade. And shall in like seasonable tyme carrie in the saide
earth after it shall be wrought, and spreade itt there, and make
flatt the floure of the dove-house, and leave itt well and orderlie.”</p>

<p>In another proclamation, issued two years after this, it was
ordered that whensoever anie ould building or
house in London <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
within three miles, is to be pulled down and removed, notice is
to be given at the king’s storehouse in Southwark, that the
deputy may first take as much of the earth and rubbish as in
his judgement and experience is fitted for salt peter for the
King’s service.”</p>

<p>Soon after, we find that this enactment which caused much
complaint, was repealed. “The manufacture of salt peter,”
says the king, “had hitherto produced much trouble and grievance
to the lieges, by occasioning the digging up the floors
of their dove-cotes, dwelling-houses, and out-houses, and had
also occasioned great charge to the salt peter men for removing
their liquors, tubbes, and other instruments, and carrying them
from place to place, but now, divers compounds of salt peter
can be extracted by other methods, for which Sir John Brooke
and Thomas Russell, Esq., have received letters patent.</p>

<p>“To encourage so laudable a project, all our loving subjects,”
continues his majesty, “inhabiting within every city, town, or
village, after notice given to them respectively, shall carefully
and constantly keep and preserve in some convenient vessels
or receptacles fit for that purpose, all the urine of man during
the whole year, and all the stale of beasts which they can save
and gather together whilst their beasts are in their stables and
stalls, and that they be careful to use the best means of
gathering together and preserving the urine and stale, without
any mixture of water or other thing put therein. Which our
commandment and royal pleasure being so easy to be observed,
and so necessary for the public service of us and our people,
that if any person be remiss thereof, we shall esteem all such
persons contemptuous and ill affected both to our person and
state, and are resolved to proceed to the punishment of that
offender with that severity we may.”</p>

<p>Sir John agreed to remove the liquid accumulations from
the houses once in every twenty-four hours in summer time,
and every forty-eight hours in winter time.</p>

<p>About the year 1670, the importation of saltpetre from the
East Indies (where it is obtained as a natural
product, being <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
disengaged by a kind of efflorescence from the surface of the
soil) had so increased as to affect the home manufacture, which
has since gradually declined and become extinct. The manufacture
of saltpetre from sources of the kind above mentioned,
is not followed in this country at the present day, and it will be
unnecessary to indicate here the process employed in France,
Sweden, Germany, and other countries for obtaining it by the
decomposition of animal refuse, the more especially as full
accounts are given in Knapp’s <i>Technology</i>, Ure’s <i>Dictionary
of Arts and Manufactures</i>, and other standard chemical works;
we shall therefore confine our attention to an account of the
processes which have been proposed for obtaining nitrate of potash
by the decomposition of nitrate of soda and other sources.</p>

<p>The first of these processes is that of adding nitrate of lime
to a solution of sulphate of potash; sulphate of lime is precipitated,
and nitrate of potash obtained in solution, which, on
evaporation yields crystals of that salt.</p>

<p>Mr. Hill’s method of manufacturing nitrate of potash is by
decomposing nitrate of soda by means of muriate of potash.
For this purpose the nitrate of soda is put into a suitable vessel,
made of wrought or cast iron, and dissolved in as much water
as is required, and then the equivalent quantity of muriate of potash
is added; decomposition ensues, with the formation of nitrate
of potash and muriate of soda; the greater portion of the latter
is separated during evaporation, as it is equally soluble at all
temperatures. The nitrate crystallizes on the cooling of the
solution. Specimens of this nitre were shown at the Great
Industrial Exhibition.</p>

<p>Mr. Rotch’s processes for converting nitrate of soda into
nitrate of potash are as follows:―</p>

<p><i>First process with American potashes, (caustic).</i>—In a suitable
round-bottomed iron boiler, he dissolves
<span class="nowrap">2000 lbs.</span>
of the
ashes in 1000 quarts of water, and then applies heat for three
hours, at the end of which time the solution ought to be of a
density of 45° Baumè, (sp. gr. 1.453). In a similar boiler he
dissolves <span class="nowrap">1300 lbs.</span>
of nitrate of soda in 1200
quarts of water, <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span>
applying the heat as before, until the solution becomes of the
density of 45° Baumé. Both solutions are then allowed to
stand for twelve hours to cool and settle. They should be heated
to from 175° to 200° Fah., and then both poured into a
third vessel or crystallizing pan, when the double decomposition
will take place, and the crystals of nitrate of potash be deposited,
this first deposition giving from 700 to <span class="nowrap">900 lbs.</span>
of good
merchantable saltpetre.</p>

<p>Care must be taken not to let the heat fall below 85°, at
which the crystals form; and the better and more regularly the
heat is kept up, the speedier will be the deposition of the crystals.
The mother-liquor should then be poured off, and the
crystals collected and thrown into the centrifugal drying machines,
where they may be washed with weak mother-liquors.
The portion of nitrate of potash that is left in the mother-liquor
may be obtained by cry­stal­li­za­tion as before.</p>

<p><i>Second process with carbonate of potash (Pearlash).</i>—The
pearlash is dissolved in water, and the solution brought to a
density of 40° Baumé (sp. gr. 1.384). This will cause whatever
sulphate of potash may be contained in it to be deposited.
The solution should then be left to stand for five or six days,
after which it should be poured off, and diluted with water,
until its density becomes 15° Baumé (sp. gr. 1,116). Caustic
lime should then be added in the proportion of one-fourth of the
weight of the original quantity of carbonate employed. It
should then be poured off from the carbonate of lime formed,
heated and mixed with the solution of nitrate of soda, as above
described. The precise proportions that the caustic alkali
should bear to the nitrate of soda, are forty-eight parts of the
former to eighty-six parts of the latter. The materials to be
used should be tested, so as to enable the just proportions to be
arranged according to the formula just given. The patentee
states that by this means a nitre is produced which is equal to
the Bengal saltpetre, after the latter has gone through the expensive
process of refining.</p>

<p>A Stockholm manufacturer says:—“On
dissolving nitrate of <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span>
soda in excess of caustic potash solution, and evaporating to 28°
or 32° Baumé (sp. gr. 1.241 or 1.285), the chief part of the
saltpetre crystallizes, contaminated by the magnesia which is
precipitated, and a small quantity of carbonate of lime. In
order to obtain the whole of the saltpetre, the solution must be
concentrated to 45° or 50° Baumé (sp. gr. 1.453 or 1.530). Here
however, a difficulty arises; the cast iron crystallizing vessels
are not impermeable to the liquor, which, whatever the thickness
of the vessels, oozes through them, thus occasioning great
loss. The saltpetre which still remains in solution after cry­stal­li­za­tion
in the caustic solution at 30° Baumé (sp. gr. 1.263),
cannot be collected, and if it be employed in the manufacture
of soap, this will be found to contain so large a proportion of
saltpetre, that it deliquesces and falls to pieces in a few days.”</p>

<p>“A method employed in the Russian manufactories is first
to dissolve the fine pearlash, and the nitrate of soda in the
relative proportions of water required for their mutual decomposition,
or rather with an excess of potash in such a quantity
of water that the resulting product remains dissolved at 50°
Reaumur. The solution is then allowed to settle, whereby the
carbonates of lime and magnesia are deposited, after which the
liquor is run off into wooden crystallizing vessels. As soon as
the temperature is lower than 50° Reaumur, the principal part
of the nitrate of potash crystallizes. The cry­stal­li­za­tion must
now be very attentively watched, for as soon as the soda begins
also to crystallize, the mother-liquors should be run off into
other vessels, where a small quantity of nitrate of potash will
crystallize, though the principal part will be soda. The nitrate of
potash and the soda must then be purified by new cry­stal­li­za­tions.
The salts formed from the mother-liquors must be redissolved
with the nitrate of potash or the soda, according to which of
the two most predominates.”</p>

<p>Messrs. Crane and Jullion patented in 1848 the following
method of manufacturing the nitrates of potash and soda:—The
oxides of nitrogen evolved in the process of manufacturing
oxalic acid, are mixed with oxygen gas or
atmospheric air, and <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
made to pass slowly through a chamber or other apparatus
containing an alkali placed on trays (similar to the lime in a
dry lime purifier), the mixed gases combine with the alkali,
forming a nitrate of potash or soda, whichever alkali may have
been employed.</p>

<p>De Sussex’s process for the manufacture of nitrate of potash
is as follows:—A solution is made of 166 pounds of nitrate of
lead, and another of 76 pounds of chloride of potassium. The
two solutions are then mixed, when double decomposition takes
place, chloride of lead being precipitated, and nitrate of potash
obtained in solution. In order to avoid the presence of lead in
the nitrate of potash, a small portion of caustic or carbonated
lime or magnesia is added, by which means any portion of the
chloride of lead remaining in solution is precipitated. The solution
of nitrate of potash is then evaporated and crystallized.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Nitrate of soda is obtained in the same way, by substituting
sixty-six pounds of chloride of sodium for the chloride of potassium
above mentioned.—<i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal and Transactions,

<h3>ON TINCTURE OF OPIUM.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Society of Antwerp has employed a
commission composed of its members to determine the best
menstruum for the preparation of tincture of opium. It has
arrived at the following results:―</p>

<p>1. Good opium gives, when treated with water, less extract
than bad or adulterated.</p>

<p>2. By warm digestion, a stronger solution is obtained than
by cold infusion.</p>

<p>3. Alcohol must be preferred to wine in the preparation of
tincture of opium.</p>

<p>4. Narcotine, although alone insoluble in water, becomes
partially extracted with the other ingredients of opium.
When it is advisable to avoid the removal
of narcotine, proceed <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
as follows:—Treat carefully prepared aqueous extract of opium
with, boiling alcohol; this dissolves out the narcotine and morphine,

are to be set aside for twenty-four hours to allow the narcotine

ammonia. To remove the last traces of morphine, the fluid,
from which the precipitated morphine has been filtered, is to
be kept in a warm place for two days, a little water having
been previously added, when a fresh quantity of morphine will
fall down. By this method, <sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>12</sub> of the weight of the opium employed,

<h3>PREPARATION OF PROPYLAMINE FROM ERGOTINE.
<span class="hsmall">
BY DR. F. L. WINCKLER.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The readers of the <i>New Repertory for Pharmacy</i>, part i., p.
22 already know that I have been for some time occupied with
the investigation of ergot, and that I obtained, by the distillation
of ergotine with potash, besides ammonia, a substance
having a very unpleasant odor, which conducted itself as a volatile
alkali, and possessed a narcotic and highly diuretic property.
This confirmation of a result which I had obtained some
years before, induced me to continue my experiments, and I
have now arrived at the conviction that
the volatile alkali <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span>
which is extracted from ergotine by distillation with potash is
propylamine (N&#x202f;H<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;C<sub>6</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>7</sub>, or N&#x202f;H<sub>3</sub>&#x202f;C<sub>6</sub>&#x202f;H<sub>6</sub>) consequently the
same which, according to the most recent experiments, is
proved to be the product of decomposition of narcotine by potash,
and the ingredient of herring-pickle. The smell itself made
me imagine, long before I was acquainted with Wertheim’s
experiments, that herring-pickle must likewise contain propylamine,
and my experiments have fully confirmed this supposition,
for in distilling herring-pickle with potash I obtained the
same propylamine as that extracted from a concentrated
aqueous solution of ergotine. The properties in which they
agree are the following:―</p>

<p>1. Propylamine saturates acids completely, and thus forms
salts soluble in water, and for the most part in spirit of wine,
with the exception of sulphate of propylamine, which does not
dissolve in the latter. Beautiful white crystals may, however,
be produced from the concentrated aqueous solution by the admixture
of alcohol of eighty per cent. of strength. The salts
of propylamine dissolved in water and treated with tannic acid
produce a white (flocculent) precipitate; with chloride of mercury
likewise, a white but pulverulent precipitate; with nitrate
of silver a white (flocculent) precipitate; and with chloride of
platinum a yellow precipitate (a crystalline powder). The salts
of propylamine have a strong odor of fresh ergot, much less of
herring-pickle, and are easily decomposed by potash.</p>

<p>2. The concentrated aqueous solution being mixed with a
fourth of its volume of tincture of iodine, a considerable dark
yellowish-brown sediment is precipitated, and the supernatant
fluid appears dark brownish-red. But in a very short time
this sediment diminishes considerably, the fluid gradually
changes color, so that in about twelve hours’ time there will be
left but very little orange-colored sediment, whilst the fluid
itself will appear almost colorless. Immediately after the addition
of iodine the very disagreeable odor of propylamine
disappears, and the mixture acquires the odor of iodine.</p>

<p>3. When the neutral aqueous solution of
sulphate of <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
propylamine is evaporated in a water-bath it exhales a very disagreeable
odor of herring, the solution becomes very acid, has only a
weak odor of ergot, and all the re-actions cease. If this concentrated
solution be digested with caustic lime in a still, there
comes over, without the aid of artificial heat, almost pure propylamine,
which has the odor of an ammoniacal liquid, and
produces all the re-actions of pure propylamine.</p>

<p>Now the propylamine of ergot presents the very same results,
and it is on this account that until lately, it has always been
mistaken for ammonia. I am convinced that it constitutes the
odorous principle of urine, perspiration, and in the blood, and
is often the cause of the odor which we observe in the action
of alkaline leys upon nitrogenous compounds. Propylamine
belongs to the organic bases, and may be considered as the adjunct
[<i>Paarling</i>] of ammonia. I think I am justified in concluding,
from the results of my experiments, that propylamine,
<i>combined with an acid</i>, pre-exists in ergot
as well as in herring-pickle,
and is not produced by the potash, as is the case with
narcotine. I have previously demonstrated the presence of
formic acid in ergot, and it is with that acid that the propylamine
seems to be united. I have not yet made any experiments
with herring-pickle.</p>

<p>It will now be difficult to determine whether the medicinal
activity of ergot depends on propylamine or not, for the neutral
salts of propylamine dissolved in water are easily absorbed,
and I hope to be able to induce physicians to make pharmacological
and therapeutical experiments.</p>

<p>I have reasons to suppose that propylamine is likewise an
ingredient of cod-liver oil, and being easily combined with
iodine, it may soon be ascertained by practical application
whether it ought not to be considered as the bearer (<i>träger</i>) of
iodine. I propose to begin the necessary experiments in this
respect as soon as my apparatus is entirely free from the odor
of propylamine, in order to avoid all error.</p>

<p>Finally, I had the idea of trying an experiment with regard
to propylamine upon my own urine, which I made
after a <span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span>
supper consisting of roast veal, potato-salad, and a glass of water,
and which was neither acid nor alkaline. I poured three ounces
of the urine, fresh made and still quite warm, upon four ounces
of burned lime, and submitted it to distillation. The distilled
product had indeed the odor of pure propylamine, and re-acted
strongly alkaline; but acted in a remarkable manner on tincture
of iodine in the same way as liquid ammonia. After
having neutralized it with sulphuric acid, the liquid showed when
tested with tannic acid and nitrate of silver, an unmistakable
proportion of propylamine. Might this be formed out of the
urea? My experiment confirms, at all events, the opinion
stated above; the beginning is made, and I may now pass from
experiment to scientific deductions.</p>

<p><i>Remarks by Dr. Buchner</i>:—My friend, Dr. Winckler, in
communicating the above paper, very agreeably surprised me
by transmitting at the same time specimens of his preparation
of propylamine, and that too in quantities varying from one to
two drachms, for which I hereby beg to express to him publicly
my best thanks. I received from him, namely:―</p>

<ul class="ulin1">
<li>1. The rough product of distillation of herring-pickle.</li>

<li>2. The aqueous solution of the sulphate produced from it.</li>

<li>3. The pure crystallized, and by spirit of wine, precipitated
sulphate of propylamine.</li>

<li>4. The concentrated solution of pure propylamine.</li>

<li>5. The aqueous solution of the sulphate prepared
with No. 4.</li></ul>

<p class="padtopc">Hitherto
I have only experimented with the preparations
No. 2, 4 and 5, in order to verify and complete the statements
of the above paper. All these solutions are quite colorless and
clear, like water; they diffuse already at some distance a strong
odor of herring; but the pure aqueous propylamine, when
smelt at closely, has a pungent odor, very similar to that of
liquid ammonia, which, however, at a distance, assumes, as it
has been said, the smell of herring. This odor is so peculiarly
char­ac­ter­is­tic, that I do not doubt, that even in water-closets,
in consequence of fermentation, propylamine is developed, particularly
as woollen clothes easily acquire there
the odor of <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
herring. All the conditions at least necessary for the formation
of propylamine ammonia, and carbo-hydrogen, are to be
found in water-closets. In a small close room its odor becomes
insupportable, and affects strongly the head. Dr. Winckler,
had therefore, good reasons to warn me against it. A young
chemist, upon whose hand I dropped a very minute quantity
of aqueous propylamine, for the purpose of ascertaining its
taste, not­with­stand­ing that he had been walking after that a
considerable distance, and had been exposed to the air, smelt
still, after some hours, so strongly of herring, that happening to
to enter a company, he was spoken to about it by several persons.
I mention this merely as a caution. The taste of pure
aqueous propylamine is pungently alkaline, and hardly distinguishable
from that of caustic ammonia.</p>

<p>The chemical re-actions of propylamine are well explained
by Winckler. Turmeric paper turns brown with it, but being
exposed to the air, in which propylamine quickly evaporates,
it resumes again its primitive yellow color.</p>

<p>Sulphate of propylamine (No. 3,) appears in small splendid
white prisms, exposed to the air it evolves a distinct smell of
herring, and has a pungent saline taste, like sulphate of ammonia;
it is entirely neutral, and when moistened with water, it
does not alter the color either of blue or red litmus-paper, or
of turmeric-paper.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>We have in solutions of silver and iodine, which are not precipitated
by ammonia, very appropriate re-agents for distinguishing
propylamine from ammonia. Propylamine, however,
treated with sulphate of silver, gave me not a white, but a
yellowish-brown precipitate; and this result suggested to me
the idea, that formiate of propylamine might be present.
This precipitate was easily and perfectly dissolved in caustic
liquid ammonia. With an aqueous solution of iodine I acquired
at one time, according to the quantitative proportion
a brown, and at another time a beautiful yellow precipitate,
which dissolved in an excess of iodide of potassium. I usually
employ an aqueous solution of iodine in
iodide of potassium <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
instead of the tincture of iodine made with spirit of wine.
The precipitate produced by iodide of potassium is, as I have
just stated, either brown or yellow, provided that no excess of
iodide of potassium be employed.—<i>Buchner’s Neues Repertorium</i>,

<h3>EDITORIAL.</h3>

<hr class="hr12" />

<p>We had intended once more to call the attention of our readers to the approaching
meeting of the National Convention, but have been anticipated by one of
our colleagues in the communication which is subjoined, giving an account of
both its origin and its objects. It is to be hoped that, as the convention will
probably assume a permanent organization, its proceedings will take on a scientific
character. Independent of the subjects which pharmacy, every where, presents,
such a body would be a fit one to assist in ascertaining and developing
the resources of our indigenous materia medica. Our country is rich in medicinal
articles, but the properties of many of them are but imperfectly known, and
comparatively little attention has been paid to their phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal preparation.
Inquiries of this kind, carried on with the aid of physicians, particularly of those
attached to hospitals, could not fail to produce important results, and they seem
peculiarly adapted to the wants of the community and to the position of the
convention.</p>

<div class="fsz6">THE NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL CONVENTION.</div>

<p>The second meeting of Phar­ma­ceu­tists, the first as a National Convention, to
which the Convention of Delegates from the several Colleges of Pharmacy, held
in New York last October, may be considered the preliminary movement, will
take place in Philadelphia, on Wednesday the 6th of October ensuing. The
convention of last fall was held chiefly for the purpose of considering the important
subject of standards of quality and purity which imported drugs ought to
possess in order to regulate and render uniform the character required of them
by the government Inspectors, at the various ports of entry in the United States.
Unofficially and officially the duty of affixing standards for imported drugs
was, with propriety, assigned to the Colleges of Pharmacy. For this object they
were called in convention for that time only, and permanent organization was
not then anticipated. But on the meeting of the Colleges, and their united
action upon the one subject of such general importance, it was a natural consequence
that a spontaneous and general feeling should arise in favor of the establishment
of a National Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Organization, with an Annual
Convention for the <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
advancement of science and for the promotion of intercourse and good will among
phar­ma­ceu­tists generally. Accordingly the preamble and resolutions brought
forward by the committee, subsequent to their report on the special business of
that convention and its action upon it, were received with hearty favor. We
think it would be well to recapitulate them:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">W<b>HEREAS</b>,</span> The advancement of the true interests of the great body of Pharmacutical
practitioners in all sections of our country is a subject worthy of earnest
consideration; and whereas Phar­ma­ceu­tists, in their intercourse among themselves,
with physicians and the public, should be governed by a code of ethics
calculated to elevate the standard and improve the practice of their art; and
whereas, the means of a regular phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal education should be offered to the
rising Phar­ma­ceu­tists by the establishment of Schools of Pharmacy in suitable
locations; and whereas, it is greatly to be desired that the united action of the
profession should be directed to the accomplishment of these objects; therefore,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That in the opinion of this Convention, much good will result from a
more extended intercourse between the Phar­ma­ceu­tists of the several sections of
the Union, by which their customs and practice may be assimilated; that Phar­ma­ceu­tists
would promote their individual interests and advance their professional
standing by forming associations for mutual protection, and the education of their
assistants, when such associations have become sufficiently matured; and that, in
view of these important ends, it is further</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a Convention be called, consisting of three delegates each from
incorporated and unincorporated Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Societies, to meet at Philadelphia,
on the first Wednesday in October, 1852, when all the importent questions
bearing on the profession may be considered, and measures adopted for the organization
of a National Association, to meet every year.</p>

<p>In accordance with these resolutions, it was resolved that the President of
the Convention be requested to transmit an invitation to the authorized bodies,
at least three months previous to the time of meeting, desiring such bodies to
acquaint him with the names of the delegates they may appoint.</p>

<p>On motion, it was resolved that the New York Delegation be appointed a Committee
to lay the proceedings of this Convention before the Secretary of the
Treasury of the United States, and afterwards have them published in pamphlet
form.</p>

<p>Dr. Philbrick of Boston, offered the following preamble and resolution, which
were adopted:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W<b>HEREAS</b>,</span> To secure the full benefits of the prohibition of sophisticated drugs
and chemicals from abroad, it is necessary to prevent home adulteration; therefore,</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That this Convention recommend to the several Colleges to adopt
such measures as in their respective states may be best calculated to secure that
object.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Colcord of Boston, it was</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That a committee of three be appointed by this Convention to act as
a Standing Committee to collect and receive such information
as may be valuable, <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
and memorials and suggestions from any Medical and Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Associations,
to be presented at the next Convention.</p>

<p>The President appointed G. D. Coggeshall of New York, S. M. Colcord of Boston,
and W. Procter, Jr., of Philadelphia, as the Committee.</p>

<p>A vote of thanks to the officers was passed, and then the Convention adjourned,
to meet in Philadelphia, on the first Wednesday in October, 1852.”</p></blockquote>

<p>We hope that the considerations embraced in the preamble and resolutions of
the committee will engage the thoughtful and earnest attention of every apothecary
every where throughout the United States, who has a just sense of the proper
dignity of his profession and an honest desire for its advancement, and that
all will feel the importance of a general gathering at the approaching convention,—one
that shall comprise a full representation of remote as well as adjacent
districts of our extended country. In the words of the resolution, “three
delegates, each, from incorporated and unincorporated phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal societies,”
are invited, but a feeling has been increasingly manifested since the last convention,
to solicit representation from all districts, small as well as large, that in
places where but few apothecaries are located—too few as they may think for
efficient organization,—they should yet feel their individual responsibility, and be
encouraged to depute one or more of their number to represent them. All, who
come in the right spirit of regard for the cause, may be sure of being welcome.—A
National Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Association will undoubtedly be organized on a similar
plan to that of the medical profession, and in it individuals may be admitted
to membership that are acceptable as worthy practioners of their art.</p>

<p>The convention will have many subjects of general interest to discuss and to
arrange for future consideration. Prominent amongst these will be, a Code of
Ethics which should govern phar­ma­ceu­tists in the performance of their duties,
and in their intercourse with each other and with physicians; the importance of
general conformity in practice with the United States Pharmacopœia; the
suppression of <i>home</i> as well as the exclusion of <i>foreign</i> adulteration; and the
driving out of quackery into its own mean company. That all these ends can at
once be attained is scarcely to be hoped for; but we trust the convention will
be composed of men who appreciate the distinctness of the honorable practice of
our profession from all malpractice and quackery, and who are fully disposed to
mark the division clearly and broadly; so that persons governed by such opposite
principles may take their separate places, and be esteemed accordingly.</p>

<p>We are authorized by Dr. Guthrie, who, since the Convention of 1851, has removed
to Memphis, Tennessee, to request that the names of delegates may be reported
to Prof. William Procter, Philadelphia,—a convenient arrangement, as
Mr. Procter is one of the delegates to the next Convention, residing in the city
where it is to be held.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>We would also invite the attention of Phar­ma­ceu­tists to the resolution introduced
by Mr. Colcord, of Boston, and hope that any suggestions they may
wish to offer, will be presented at an early day to one of the committee appointed,
to rceive them.</p>

<h4>POISONING BY ADULTERATED CIDER.</h4>

<p>A number of cases of lead poisoning, two of which terminated fatally, have
lately occurred at Paris, which have been traced to the use of cider, clarified by
a mixture of acetate of lead and carbonate of potassa. The history of this matter
shows the efficacy of the French law regarding the use of poisonous substances,
and the rigor with which it is enforced:―</p>

<p>Several manufacturers, were accused of having sold cider adulterated and containing
substances injurious to health; others in addition to this, of having
caused various internal injuries to different individuals, and one M. Henon,
further of having thus caused the death of two individuals.</p>

<p>One of the witnesses testified, that he had purchased cider at the establishment
of the defendant, that some days after drinking it he had been attacked with
colic, and constant tremblings; by the advice of his physician, he sent a quantity
of the suspected cider to the prefect of police for analysis. A number of other
witnesses who had been poisoned, made statements to the same effect.</p>

<p>M. Chevallier deposed, that he had received a letter from the prefect of the
police, enclosing one from the physician of the plaintiff, who stated that a number
of his patients had been rendered ill by the use of this cider; that he had, in
consequence of this, inspected the various establishments in which the manufacture
of cider was carried on, and that he has ascertained the presence of lead
in the cider obtained at establishments of the accused.</p>

<p>Several physicians testified, that the symptoms under which their patients
(the witnesses) had labored, were due to lead poisoning.</p>

<p>M. Dubail, a <i>Pharmacien</i>, testified that he had furnished M. Henon, (one of the
accused), with a mixture of acetate of lead and carbonate of potassa, which M. H.
stated, that by the advice of one of his clerks, he intended to use in the clarification
of cider. That he had cautioned M. H. regarding its employment, and had
furnished him with a re-agent for the purpose of detecting any lead which might
not be precipitated in the cider thus clarified.</p>

<p>The trial was commenced on the 9th of May, continued upon the 11th, and
judgment rendered on the 18th.</p>

<p>Henon, the use of whose cider had caused two deaths, was condemned to 18
months imprisonment and to pay a fine of 800 francs; a second, to 8 months imprisonment
and a fine of 500 francs; a third, to 6 months imprisonment and 500
francs; while a fourth party, accused only of selling adulterated cider, but to the
employment of which no injury had been traced, was imprisoned 3 months and
fined 100 francs. M. Henon was condemned to pay 24,050 francs in addition
as damages; another of the accused, the sum of 1500 francs.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Truly, if the Prince President has been rather free in the employment of lead
in the streets of Paris, the government takes good care that its citizens shall not
be poisoned by it with impunity.</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,—Your kind and courteous favor of the 16th
instant, on behalf of the Publishing Committee of the New
York Journal of Pharmacy, asking “information respecting
the character of imported drugs and medicines coming under
my supervision; and also, information in reference to the general
working and effect of the drug law of 1848,” has been before
me for several days, waiting such response, in the shape of
a full and lengthy communication in detail, as it was my wish
to furnish; but pressing and increasing official duties compel
me, from want of time (not material), to forego that pleasure and
confine myself to a brief statement of facts and data, which,
together with some general observations, I am in hopes may,
nevertheless, be found interesting to your readers.</p>

<p>As an evidence of the beneficial effects of the wise sanitary
measure, in the success of which, we have all taken so much
interest, I am pleased to say that the character and quality
of the more important articles of drugs, medicines and chemical
preparations, connected with medicine at present presented
for entry from abroad, is greatly improved, and of a far higher
standard of strength and purity than formerly; not­with­stand­ing,
as will be seen, I still have occasion to apply the “veto
power”—a labor of love, which must, of
necessity, be <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
performed in order to arrest the unhallowed strides of deception
and fraud which will ever be practised, to a greater or less
extent, as long as we have those among us, engaged in any
department of the drug trade, who, to put money in their
purse, would endanger, if not sacrifice the lives of their fellow
men. The law in question has now been in operation at this
port something more than four years; and, with the exception
of some eleven months, the duties and re­spon­si­bi­li­ties of its
ad­min­i­stra­tion have devolved upon me. On the 21st day of
April, 1849, I made a report to the New York Academy of
Medicine, on the practical operation of this law, and stated
therein the more important articles of drugs and medicines,
with the quantities annexed, rejected by me up to that date;
but as that report is doubtless familiar to most of your readers,
I have not deemed it necessary to repeat them here. The
following are the more important articles, with the quantities
annexed, that I have since rejected and condemned as not of
the requisite strength and purity to be safely and properly
used for medicinal purposes, viz:―</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Making
altogether some five hundred and twenty thousand
pounds, to say nothing of various articles in small quantities
rejected from time to time, which I have not considered of sufficient
importance to note down. This, together with the ninety
thousand pounds previously rejected, as stated in an early report
above alluded to, makes some six hundred and ten thousand
pounds of various articles of drugs and medicines condemned
by me as unfit for medicinal purposes since the law
took effect at this port. What articles and in what quantities,
were rejected during the eleven months that I was absent from
the office, I am not advised, neither am I at this time able
to say what has been done under the requirements of this act
at the other ports of entry. I hope, however, that the special
examiners can give a good account of their stewardship, and
that they will not hesitate to do so, whenever the information
is desirable as a means of pushing on the column of medical
and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal reform. <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span></p>

<p>It will be seen by the above statement, that by far the largest
quantity of any one article rejected, is that of spurious
Peruvian bark, or as it is generally known in commerce, Carthagena
and Maracaibo bark; and that too, as a general thing
of the poorest and most worthless quality. The best of this
bark affords on analysis only an exceedingly small percentage
of quinine, not unfrequently, but a mere trace; while, at the
same time, it yields as high as two, and occasionally with
choice samples, two and a half per cent of a <i>peculiar</i> alkaloid
which has been named <i>quinidine</i>, in contra-distinction to quinine,
cinchonine, and aricine, (the three alkaloids heretofore
obtained from the different varieties of the cinchona tribe of
plants,) from which it differs essentially in several respects.</p>

<p>What <i>is quinidine, medicinally understood</i>? How does
<i>sulphate</i> of quinidine <i>compare with sulphate of
quinine</i> (from
which it is very difficult to distinguish it by the naked eye,)
medicinally, as a remedial agent in cases where the use of the
latter salt is particularly indicated? These are important
questions, and the subject is one very properly at the present
time calling for prompt, patient, and persevering investigation
by all those whose mission it is to prepare, dispense or prescribe
the most efficient means wherewith to combat disease; the
more so for the reason, that I have detected in most of the sulphate
of quinine lately imported from abroad, more or less of
this non-officinal, and (in my opinion) as compared with quinine,
non-efficient substance yclept quinidine; a fact readily
accounted for, when it is known that for the last year or two
immense quantities of the bark in question, good, bad, and
indifferent, have been exported from New Grenada, (as well as
much from this port that had been rejected) and purchased by
foreign manufacturing chemists, for the purpose, as I have
reason to believe, of mixing it with the <i>true</i> bark in the manufacture
of sulphate of quinine; hence the hybrid salt now too
frequently presented to entry; a practice that, if not speedily
abandoned, will ruin as far as this country is concerned, the
formerly well deserved reputation of more than
one of the <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span>
foreign manufacturers of sulphate of quinine I could name.
The argument maintained by some of them that the article is
used in their hospitals and found equal to pure quinine, will
not answer on this side of the water; it smacks too much of the
almighty dollar, even as I must believe (until further advised)
at the expense of truth.</p>

<p>This comparatively inert substance, quinidine, is readily
detected by using the method adopted by Zimmer, and published
in the March number of the Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal
(London), and, as I was happy to see, transfered to the columns
of the May number of your valuable Journal. It is a test so
perfect, so scientifically practical, and so simple withal, that
any one possessing only a moderate share of chemical and
analytical acumen can successfully apply it, even though perchance
he may not be able to boast of wearing the mantle of
the departed Berzelins, or of having been a favorite pupil of
Liebig.</p>

<p>The law went into operation at this port on the 12th day of
July, 1848, and it is worthy of remark, as a cause of gratulation,
on the part of the early friends of the measure, that the
importation of inferior and worthless qualities of many important
drugs and medicines, has since gradually and greatly decreased
in quantity. For instance, I rejected during the first
seven months of the working of the law 19,989 pounds of
Rhubarb root; but I have since rejected only 5,782 pounds,
being but a fraction over one third of the quantity. For the
past eighteen months, I have not had occasion to reject a single
pound. I rejected during the first nine months 3,347
pounds of opium; but have since, during a period of more
than two years and a half of my ad­min­i­stra­tion of the law, as
will be seen by the above statement, rejected only 3,164
pounds. For the past thirteen months I have rejected only
nine hundred and fifty two pounds, while I have passed during
that period not less than 70,000 pounds. During the first two
months of the operation of the law, I rejected 1,414 pounds of
gamboge, but have since met with that only which
I was ready <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
to pass without any hesitation. During the first nine months
I rejected 2,977 pounds of gum myrrh, but all that has since
been presented to entry at this port, I have found satisfactory.
Thus might I continue, but time and space will not permit.
Enough I opine, has been said and shown to satisfy even the
most prejudiced and sceptical opponent of this wise measure,
that if faithfully and judiciously administered, <i>and seconded
with becoming zeal and honesty of purpose by the medical
profession, the pharmaceutist and dispensing apothecary</i>, it
is calculated and destined to effect most beneficial and lasting
sanitary reforms throughout the length and breadth of our
vast and glorious land. In a word, the law has operated thus
far remarkably well considering the hasty manner in which it
was framed and passed through Congress. It is, in some respects
imperfect, as must ever be the case with all new measures
of legislation until their utility is tested by practical
operation; but these imperfections were, some time since,
brought to the attention of the Secretary of the Treasury,
who, with his accustomed promptitude soon after instructed me
to report to the Department such manifestations and suggestions
as my experience in the ad­min­i­stra­tion of the law should
dictate as most desirable, practicable, and judicious; and, not­with­stand­ing
this important and responsible trust has necessarily
been made the subject of the few occasional leisure moments
I could from time to time command, apart from other
official duties, it is nearly completed, and, in a manner too, as
I have reason to believe, that will render the law, when amended
as proposed, satisfactory to all honorable dealers, importers,
owners, and consignees, and, at the same time do away with
the not unreasonable objections entertained by our marine insurance
companies; while its efficiency instead of being in any
manner impaired by the amendments, will be more perfectly
guarded and essentially strengthened. The particulars and
details connected with this duty I must defer until another
time; but I must be permitted before closing this communication
to say, that to the present
able and distinguished <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span>
head of the Treasury Department, Hon. Thomas Corwin, is
due a debt of gratitude, from all true friends of this important
measure, not easily cancelled. Soon after he was called to
take upon himself the re­spon­si­bil­i­ties of one of the most important,
and by far the most arduous offices under the general
government, the downward and fatal tendency of a mal­ad­min­is­tra­tion
of the law was brought to his notice; when,
rising <i>above all minor considerations</i>, he rescued it from impending
danger, and placed it upon what he deemed a safe
basis; and has since, on all occasions, lent a willing ear to
every suggestion calculated to render it more perfect, to add
to its efficiency, or perpetuate its usefulness. A noble example
truly, and one well worthy of the man.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>To conclude, I beg to say, that although I have not the
honor of belonging to any Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Association, I nevertheless
take great interest in everything calculated to advance
the good cause and noble calling in which you have so long
been engaged; and, I hope the day is not far distant, when
every city and town of importance throughout this wide extended
country, will be favored with an organization of the
kind, radiating from a <i>National</i> Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Association
as a common center. It would be of vast benefit to the community
at large, as well as eminently useful to the medical
profession; for as all must admit, it is of the most vital importance
to the success of the physician, that his remedial agents
are properly prepared by a well-bred and perfectly educated
chemist and pharmaceutist; and, I may add my conviction,
that medical and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal chemistry, a part of medical
education that has thus far been most unpardonably neglected,
should be universally and efficiently taught in our Schools of
Medicine.</p>

<h3>ON THE USE OF COAL GAS AS A SOURCE OF HEAT FOR THE LABORATORY.
<span class="hsmall">
BY EDWARD N. KENT.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Having recently fitted up a new laboratory in which I have
introduced coal gas as a source of heat, I have thought a description
of the apparatus and manner of using it, would be interesting
to chemists and phar­ma­ceu­tists, as it has not been
very generally applied to this purpose as yet in this country,
although in England, where alcohol is dear, it has long been
used as a substitute.</p>

<p>In the use of coal gas as a source of heat, the principal difficulty
to be avoided, is its tendency to smoke; this I have accomplished
in a variety of ways. The ordinary argand gas
burner, fixed permanently upon a branch pipe passing up
through the table, is one of the cheapest, and a convenient arrangement
for many purposes, and to prevent smoke, a tall
glass chimney, or a short sheet iron chimney, with every other
hole in the burner plugged, so as to make separate and distinct
jets for the air to pass through, is all that is necessary. A tripod
or sheet iron cylinder, for supporting vessels over the flame,
is an indispensable addition to this burner. There is one objection
to this form of apparatus, which is, that it is <i>fixed</i>,
and cannot be moved about like a lamp. To avoid this inconvenience,
I have had a number of burners constructed in different
ways, and connected with flexible tubes, so as to admit of
a change of position, to any place within the length of the tube.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth09">
<img src="images/i296.jpg" width="288" height="498" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 1.</div></div>

<p>Figure 1, is a gas burner designed as a
substitute for the Rose Lamp, and when
connected to the gas pipe by means of a
flexible tube, answers every purpose of that
excellent lamp without being liable to the
danger of catching fire, or to the necessity
of replenishing during an operation, as is
the case with most alcohol lamps. The
above arrangement consists of an ordinary
argand gas burner, with every other hole
plugged, fixed to an arm with
a socket and <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
thumb screw, by means of which it can be raised to any height
on the rod attached to a moveable wooden foot. The lower
part of the burner is provided with a screw to which the flexible
tube is attached, by means of a Hare’s gallows screw connector.
The other end of the flexible tube should be provided
with a stopcock, at its union with the fixed gas pipes for
regulating the supply of the gas. Above the burner is a moveable
ring, with socket and thumb screw, for supporting retorts,
flasks, etc., at any desired height. A glass chimney is represented
in the figure, but this may be replaced with a short
sheet iron chimney, when part of the holes in the burner have
been plugged as before mentioned. The above burner is well
adapted for use with the wire gauze chimney, as the moveable
ring with the addition of a wire tripod, answers as a support
for a platina crucible. To insure a perfect combustion of the
mixture of gas and air, I find that the sheet iron cylinder should
be about ten inches high and two inches diameter. Over such
a cylinder, with the upper end covered with wire gauze, it is
an easy matter to fuse carbonate of soda, or other substance requiring
a bright red heat. When the combustion is perfect
with the above cylinder, the flame is of a pale blueish white
color, like that of a solid flame from alcohol but much hotter.
With the addition of a small conical chimney of sheet iron,
placed over the mixed gas-burner, so as to bring the blue flame
to a smaller compass, I find it a very convenient and powerful
flame for bending glass tubes, by which tubes of any
diameter, or the neck of a retort, may be easily softened and
bent.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth09">
<img src="images/i297.jpg" width="288" height="235" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 2.</div></div>

<p>Figure 2, is an argand burner, with
every other hole plugged, attached to a
heavy brass foot, and with an arm and
stopcock, to which a long flexible tube is
attached, the other end of which is connected
to a pendant above the table.
This burner is well adapted for use on
any part of the table, and may be used with
an ordinary retort <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span>
stand, or with a sheet iron cylinder, for supporting vessels over
the flame. It has all the conveniences without the disadvantages
of a Berzelius’ Lamp, as it requires no wicks or replenishing,
and cannot take fire; and the stopcock is not liable
to get out of order, as is the case with the rack and pinion of
the alcoholic lamp.<br class="brclearfix" /></p>

<div class="dleft dwth08">
<img src="images/i298a.jpg" width="288" height="241" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 3.</div></div>

<p>Figure 3, is a large burner, six
inches in diameter, with the holes
placed far enough apart to form distinct
jets of the burning gas, by
which means smoke is entirely prevented
without the use of any chimney.
This burner, like the preceding,
is attached to a heavy brass
foot, and with an arm and stopcock,
to which a long flexible tube is attached, by means of which it
can be moved to any part of the
table.<br class="brclearfix" /></p>

<div class="dleft dwth09">
<img src="images/i298b.jpg" width="288" height="392" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig. 4.</div></div>

<p>This burner is provided with a large
sheet iron cylinder, (figure 4) with air
holes at the top and bottom, a slit at the
side, to go over the arm of the burner,
and a door in front for convenience in
lighting the gas, and thus forms a powerful
and convenient gas furnace, by means
of which a gallon of water can be easily
boiled. With this arrangement the confined
heat is so great, that it is necessary
to protect the table from burning, by means of sheet iron, or
other suitable material.<br class="brclearfix" /></p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>In point of economy, coal gas is cheaper than alcohol for
fuel, even in America where the latter is so cheap, and the
price of gas is comparatively high; and, it is to be hoped, that
the price of the latter will be reduced, so that coal gas may
yet be used with economy, as a source of heat for domestic
as well as for chemical and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal purposes. The
present price should be no detriment to its free use,
as it is, <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span>
undoubtedly, the most cleanly and convenient fuel which
can be used in the laboratory; and, as such, I would strongly
recommend it to those, for whom the above description has been
prepared.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3>NOTE UPON CICUTA (CONIUM MACULATUM) AND CONICINE.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Since Stoerck, who first extolled the virtues of Hemlock,
this plant has undergone numerous alterations of credit and
neglect which may be explained by the want of certainty, or
rather by the irregularity, of its action.</p>

<p>An important work has just appeared on this subject, executed
conjointly by a physician and pharmacien of Lyons,
MM. Devay and Guillermond. This work, which developes
and completes what has been said upon the medicinal virtues
of hemlock, furnishes a new element which will fix, we believe,
the therapeutic value of that substance. It is the substitution
of the seed like fruits for the other parts of the plant. We will
briefly explain the motive of that preference.</p>

<p>The principle to which cicuta owes both its toxicological and
therapeutic powers has received the names of cicuta, coneine
and conicine, the last of which is now generally adopted. It
is a volatile alkaloid, of a sharp penetrating, disagreeable smell,
somewhat like that of mice. It is of an oily consistence, and
easily decomposed by heat. In these respects it resembles
nicotine. But, a char­ac­ter­is­tic readily recognized and which
distinguishes it from the latter, when shaken with water it
again floats upon the surface, while nicotine is immediately
dissolved by that liquid.</p>

<p>The volatility of conicine, the readiness with which
it is <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span>
decomposed by heat or time alone, are such that the Lyonese
experimenters do not hesitate to propose the abandonment
both of the herb itself, and of all the pharmaceutic forms prepared
by the aid of heat, or in which the conicine is susceptible
of undergoing decomposition. We think this is going rather
too far. The extracts of cicuta prepared with care, and particularly
those prepared in vacuo, are of daily service. We
have been able to verify by trituration with potassa, the presence
of conicine in a hydro-alcoholic extract, a number of
years old. But, not­with­stand­ing, recognizing the fact that the
preparations of cicuta of this kind are often inert, we agree
with the experimenters that it is of consequence to escape from
such a state of things.</p>

<p>The tincture of cicuta prepared with the fresh plant, is a
very beautiful product, but made from parts of the plant containing
but a small proportion of conicine, or at all events containing
it in very variable proportions, may be inert or irregular
in its action. What then is to be done? employ conicine
itself? But the preparation of the alkaloid is difficult; it is
promptly decomposed by contact with the air and light, and
the apportionment of its dose, offers serious inconveniences.</p>

<p>There is a organ of the plant in which its active principle is
found in larger and more constant proportion, and under conditions
in which it is better preserved than in any other; that organ
is the fruit. It is at the moment of its most perfect development,
when the plant commences to flower, that it contains
the largest proportion of conicine, and that the principle is
most perfectly elaborated. At a later period it disappears and
is fixed in the fruit, in which it is concentrated in great quantity.
It is in the fruit that we seek it when we wish to extract
it. It is in the fruit we should seek it for medical use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P<b>HARMACEUTICAL</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>REPARATIONS.</b></span>
<span class="smcap">F<b>ORMULÆ.</b></span>—“Having
shown by experiment as well as by reasoning, that the fruit of
the cicuta (akène) should henceforth replace all the preparations
of the plant employed in medicine: we have to make known
the use we have made of this fact. It is important
in the first <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span>
place, that the fruit employed should be that of the great
cicuta, and that it should not be mingled with seeds of the
other umbelliferæ. They may be known by being almost
globular with five crenelated sides.</p>

<p>When the fruit is divided, the sides fold in the form of a
crescent. They do not possess like most of the other umbelliferæ,
a peculiar aromatic odor. This appears to be covered by
that of conicine. The fool’s parsley, (<i>æthusa cynapium</i>,) the
phellandrium aquaticum, the anise, bear fruits which, physically,
have much resemblance to that of the cicuta; but, when the latter
is pulverized, the char­ac­ter­is­tic odor which is developed is
sufficient to enable us readily to recognize it. Another precaution
to be taken is in relation to the time at which the fruit
should be collected. Those which were employed in our experiments
and preparations had reached the perfection of their maturity.
It is then it should be collected for medical use, because
then it is isolated, so to speak, from the plant which produces
it; the active principle exists then in them in a true state
of concentration and permanence.</p>

<p>1st. <span class="smcap">F<b>ORMULÆ</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">FOR</span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NTERNAL</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">USE.</span>—“The fruit of the cicuta
does not need any complicated pharmaceutic preparation. It
is active enough of itself to be employed in its natural condition.
A very simple manipulation only seems necessary to
facilitate its use. It is to reduce it to powder and to form it
into pills, which, coated with sugar, may be preserved an indefinite
time. We have thought best to give the pills two
degrees of strength according to the following formulæ.</p>

<p>“<i>Pills of Cicuta, No. 1.</i>—Take one gramme of the fruit of
the cicuta recently pulverized; make with a sufficient quantity
of sugar and of syrup a mass, to be divided into 100 pills.
These are to be covered with sugar; each pill will weigh about
10 centigrammes. These are suited to persons who are not yet
habituated to the use of the drug, and who are of a delicate
constitution. We commence with two pills the first day, and
the dose is augmented day by day to 10, 15, or 20. It is then
most convenient to employ
pills No. 2. <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span></p>

<p><i>Pills No. 2.</i>—Take 5 grammes of the recently powdered
fruit of the cicuta; incorporate them with a sufficient quantity
of gum and sugar; divide as before into 100 pills, which are to
be enveloped with sugar, each pill will weigh about 25 centigrammes.</p>

<p>“We will finish the series of internal medicines by the formula
of a syrup of conicine, which will be of the greatest utility
to practitioners.</p>

<p>“Exhaust 10 grammes of the fruit of the cicuta, with alcohol
at 28° C. (82 F.) so as to obtain 60 grammes, to which 3000
grammes of syrup, aromatised, <i>ad libitum</i>, are to be added.</p>

<p>“Thirty grammes of this syrup represent 1 decigramme of
the fruit or a milligramme of conicine. A teaspoonful being
the equivalent of 30 grammes of syrup, the patient who takes
one pill of No. 2. will be able to take half a teaspoonful of the
syrup.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F<b>ORMULA</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">FOR</span>
<span class="smcap">E<b>XTERNAL</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">USE.</span>—<i>Balm of Conicine.</i>—The
process which we employ to prepare the balm of conicine
authorizes us to give it that name. It is in effect, a true solution
in lard freed from the principles which retain it in combination,
and as pure as the processes we have proposed for its
extraction will permit. Thus, after having exhausted the fruit
by alcohol, and after having separated as completely as possible
the conicine by means of ether and caustic potash, confining
ourselves to the precautions indicated below, we take:
the ether of cicuta, obtained by the exhaustion of 100 grammes
of the fruit, and 300 grammes of recently washed lard.
We begin by evaporating the ether in the open air, that is, by
pouring it little by little in a plate, and as soon as the greater
part of it has been eliminated, and the conicine commences to
appear upon the plate in the form of little yellow drops, separating
themselves from the vehicle, the lard is to be incorporated
with it by degrees, the whole being constantly stirred
to facilitate the evaporation of the ether. A balm of conicine
is thus obtained, exceedingly active and convenient for
use. <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span></p>

<p>The following is the mode of preparing the ether of cicuta:
“The alcoholic tincture obtained by the complete exhaustion of
100 grammes of the fruit, is to be evaporated to the consistence
of a syrup, and the alcohol is to be replaced by a small quantity
of water. This leaves undissolved a thick green oil, entirely
soluble in ether, and of which the quantity reaches the
weight of 30 grammes. After having separated this green
oil, we wash with ether the product of the alcoholic evaporation
and obtain a yellowish resinous substance, which has no
action on litmus paper and which has a strong odor, <i>sui generis</i>,
different from that of conicine.</p>

<p>After having submitted the mother waters of the alcoholic
extract to this preliminary treatment, we have introduced them
into a flask having a capacity three times as great as their
volume, and treated them successively with a concentrated
solution of caustic potash and rectified sulphuric ether. Immediately
after the addition of the potash, a well marked odor of
conicine was manifest in the mixture, and the ether became
strongly alkaline. We left the same ether, (about 20 grammes)
upon the mixture for twelve hours, often agitating it. It was
then decanted and replaced by fresh ether, and this was replaced
until the ether became nearly insensible to litmus
paper. We remarked that the first 20 grammes of ether took
up nearly all the alkaloid. One hundred grammes of well rectified
ether was sufficient to remove almost completely the
alkaloid from the extractive and alkaline mixture derived from
100 grammes of the fruit of the cicuta.</p>

form, but it is important to avoid in materia medica a matter
of form which may give rise to a false idea of things, which
may in a word, induce error.</p>

<p class="fsz6 padtopa">[The facts on which the preference of the seeds of conium
to the preparations in ordinary use are founded, are by no
means new. They have been long known and frequently commented
on. From six lbs. of the fresh and nine of the dried
fruit, Geiger obtained an ounce of conia, or, as the French
chemists prefer to call it, conicine; while from

Most of what is found in the shop is entirely inert; while the
best, that of Tilden or of Currie, which are superior to the best
English extract we have seen, possess comparatively little
power. If conium is to be retained in the materia media, it is
evident that we should employ that part of the plant in which
the active principle is contained in the greatest quantity, and
in a condition least liable to alteration. We are as yet, however,
very imperfectly acquainted with the properties, either
medicinal or poisonous of conium; and, as the continuation of
the memoir of MM. Devay and Guillermond promises us a
solution of the question, we await it with much interest.]—<span class="smcap">E<b>D.</b></span>

<h3>ON THE MANUFACTURE OF WRITING INKS.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>In the manufacture of good writing ink, more nicety is required
in the choice of materials, as well as greater skill in
manipulation, than is generally bestowed upon it.</p>

<p>The proportion of the various ingredients used is a matter of
considerable importance, affecting in a great degree the durability
of the ink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D<b>R.</b></span>
<span class="smcap">L<b>EWIS’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">W<b>RITING</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—Dr. Lewis, who instituted a
series of very careful experiments on the manufacture of writing
ink, found that equal parts of sulphate of iron and of galls
gave an ink, which, although of a good color when first used, became
yellowish-brown when the writing was kept for a moderate
length of time, and that in proportion to the quantity of
the sulphate, the inks were less durable in color, and that those
in which the galls were in excess, were most durable.</p>

<p>He, therefore, recommended the following proportions as best
suited for the manufacture of good writing ink:—Powdered
sulphate of iron, <span class="nowrap">1 oz.;</span>
powdered logwood, <span class="nowrap">1 oz.;</span>
powdered
galls, <span class="nowrap">3 oz.;</span>
gum arabic, <span class="nowrap">1 oz.;</span>
white wine or vinegar, 1 quart.</p>

<p>Water will answer for common purposes, but white wine
formed a blacker ink than water, and vinegar formed one still
blacker than wine. The addition of spirit injured the color,
and occasioned a precipitation of coloring matter—a decoction
of logwood, instead of water, improved both the beauty and
deepness of the black. The ingredients are to be put in a glass
or other convenient vessel, not metallic, and the mixture shaken
four or five times a day. In ten or twelve days it will be fit
for use, and sooner if in a warm situation; but it continues for
a long time to improve if left without decantation. When it is
separated from the powdery residue, it will be kept in a good
state with greater certainty, if some broken galls freed from
the powder and some pieces of iron are put into it. Iron, however,
is the only metal which it is safe to retain in contact with
the ink.</p>

<p>Dr. Lewis gave the preference to distilled or
rain water in <span class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span>
the manufacture of ink, but it seems probable that a water containing
a certain proportion of carbonate of lime is more suitable.
In dyeing a black color by means of galls or sumach
and copperas, hard spring water is preferred by some dyers.
To produce in a liquid a given depth of color, distilled water
requires more dyestuff than common spring water. This is illustrated
in the following experiment, devised by Mr. Phillips:
into two glass jars of the same size, each half-filled with distilled
water, introduce equal quantities of infusion or tincture
of galls or sumach, and an equal number of drops (only three
or four) of a solution of copperas; a faint purplish color will be
developed in both jars, but if one is filled with spring water,
the color in that rapidly becomes dark reddish-black, and one-half
more water is required to reduce it to the same shade of
color as the other. The water which is found by experience
to be best adapted for dyeing with galls and sulphate of iron,
differs from distilled water in containing sulphate of lime, carbonate
of lime held in solution by free carbonic acid, and
chloride of calcium. The beneficial ingredient seems to be the
carbonate of lime, which possesses slight alkaline properties,
for if the smallest quantity of ammonia or of bicarbonate of
potash is added to the distilled water in the above experiments,
the purple color is struck as rapidly and as deeply as in the
spring water; chloride of calcium and sulphate of lime, on the
contrary, produce no sensible change either in the depth of
color or the tint. The effect is no doubt referable to the
action of the alkali or lime on the proto-sulphate of iron, by
which the sulphuric acid of the latter is withdrawn, and hydrated
protoxide of iron set free, for protoxide of iron is much
more easily peroxidized and acted upon by tannic and gallic
acids (the dyeing principles of galls) when in the free and hydrated
state, than when in combination with sulphuric acid.
Neither the caustic fixed alkalies (potash and soda) nor their
carbonates can be well introduced in the above experiments,
as the slightest excess reacts on the purple color, converting it
into a reddish-brown. Ammonia, lime-water,
and the alkaline <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
bicarbonates also produce a reddening, and if applied in considerable
quantity a brownish tinge. It is very probable that
the above-mentioned principle is applicable to the preparation
of writing ink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">R<b>IBANCOURT’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">W<b>RITING</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—M. Ribancourt, who paid
much attention to the preparation of inks, stated that none of
the ingredients should be in excess. “If there be a want of
the matter of galls, part of the vitriol will not be decomposed;
if, on the contrary, there be too much, the vitriol will take as
much as it can decompose, and the remainder will be nearly
in the state of the decoction of galls, subject to change by becoming
mouldy, or to undergo an alteration after writing which
destroys its legibility much more completely than the change
undergone by ink containing too small a portion of the galls.</p>

<p>“It is doubtful whether the principles of the galls are well
extracted by cold maceration, and it is certain that inks made
in this way flow pale from the pen, and are not of so deep a
black as those wherein strong boiling is recurred to.”</p>

<p>From all the foregoing considertions, M. Ribancourt gives
the following directions for the composition of good ink:―</p>

<p>“Take <span class="nowrap">8 oz.</span>
of Aleppo galls (in coarse powder); <span class="nowrap">4 oz.</span>
of logwood (in thin chips); <span class="nowrap">4 oz.</span>
of vitriol of iron; <span class="nowrap">3 oz.</span>
of gum arabic (in powder); <span class="nowrap">1 oz.</span>
of vitriol of copper; and <span class="nowrap">1 oz.</span>
of sugar-candy. Boil the galls and logwood together in
<span class="nowrap">12 lb</span>
of water for one hour, or till half the liquid has evaporated.
Strain the decoction through a hair sieve or linen cloth, and
then add the other ingredients. Stir the mixture till the whole
is dissolved (more especially the gum), after which leave it to
subside for twenty-four hours. Then decant the ink, and preserve
it in bottles of glass or stoneware well corked.” The
sulphate of copper must be omitted in the preparation of an
ink required for steel pens.</p>

<span class="smmaj">THE</span>
<span class="smcap">M<b>ANUFACTURE</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">OF</span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—A
few years since, Dr. Bostock presented to the Society of
Arts the following, valuable communication “On the Properties
of Writing Inks,” which will be
read with interest. <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span></p>

<p>“When the sulphate of iron and the infusion of galls are
added together, for the purpose of forming ink, we may presume
that the metallic salt or oxide enters into combination
with at least four proximate vegetable principles, viz: gallic
acid, tan, mucilage, and extractive matter, all of which
appear to enter into the composition of the soluble part
of the gall-nut. It has been generally supposed that two of
these, the gallic acid and the tan, are more especially necessary
to the constitution of ink; and hence it is considered, by our
best systematic writers, to be essentially a tannogallate of iron.
It has been also supposed that the peroxide of iron alone possesses
the property of forming the black compound which constitutes
ink, and that the substance of ink is rather mechanically
suspended in the fluid than dissolved in it.</p>

<p>“Ink, as it is usually prepared, is disposed to undergo certain
changes, which considerably impair its value; of these,
the three following are the most important:—Its tendency to
moulding; the liability of the black matter to separate from
the fluid, the ink then becoming what is termed ropy; and loss
of color, the black first changing to brown, and at length almost
entirely disappearing.</p>

<p>“Besides these, there are objects of minor importance to be
attended to in the formation of ink. Its consistence should be
such as to enable it to flow easily from the pen, without, on
the one hand, its being so liquid as to blur the paper, or on the
other, so adhesive as to clog the pen and be long in drying.
The shade of color is not to be disregarded; a black approaching
to blue is more agreeable to the eye than browner ink;
and a degree of lustre or glossiness, if compatible with due
consistence of the fluid, tends to render the characters more
legible and beautiful.</p>

<p>“With respect to the chemical constitution of ink, I may
remark that, although as usually prepared it is a combination
of the metallic salt or oxide with all the four vegetable principles
mentioned above, yet I am induced to believe that the
last three of them, so far from being essential,
are the principal <span class="xxpn" id="p309">{309}</span>
cause of the difficulty that we meet with in the formation of a
perfect and durable ink.</p>

<p>“I endeavored to prove this point by a series of experiments,
of which the following is a brief extract.</p>

<p>“Having prepared a cold infusion of galls, I allowed a portion
of it to remain exposed to the atmosphere, in a shallow
capsule, Until it was covered with a thick stratum of mould,
the mould was removed by filtration, and the proper proportion
of sulphate of iron being added to the clear fluid, a compound
was formed of a deep black color, which showed no further
tendency to mould, and which remained for a long time
without experiencing any further alteration. Another portion
of the same infusion of galls had solution of isinglass added to
it, until it no longer produced a precipitate; by employing the
sulphate of iron, a black compound was produced, which, although
paler than that formed from the entire fluid, appeared
to be a perfect and durable ink.</p>

<p>“Lastly, a portion of the infusion of galls, was kept for some
time at the boiling temperature, by which means a part of its
contents became insoluble; this was removed by filtration,
when, by addition of sulphate of iron, a very perfect and durable
ink was produced.</p>

<p>“In the above three processes, I conceive that a considerable
part of the mucilage, of the tan, and the extract, were respectively
removed from the infusion, whilst the greatest part
of the gallic acid would be left in solution.</p>

<p>“The three causes of deterioration in ink, the moulding, the
precipitation of black matter, and loss of color, as they are distinct
operations, so we may presume that they depend on the
operation of different proximate principles.</p>

<p>“It is probable that the moulding more particularly depends
©n the mucilage, and the precipitation on the extract, from the
property, which extractive matter possesses of forming insoluble
compounds with metallic oxides.</p>

<p>“As to the operation of the tan, from its affinity for metallic
salt we may conjecture that, in the first instance,
it forms a <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span>
triple compound with the gallic acid and the iron, and that in
consequence of the decomposition of the tan, this compound is
afterwards destroyed. Owing to the difficulty, if not impossibility,
of entirely depriving the infusion of galls of any one of
its ingredients without in some degree affecting the others, I
was not able to obtain any results which can be regarded as
decisive; but the general result of my experiments favors the
above opinion, and leads me to conclude that, in proportion as
ink consists merely of the gallate of iron it is less liable to decomposition
or to experience any kind of change. The experiments
to which I have alluded above, consisted in forming a
standard solution by macerating the powder of galls in five
times its weight of water, and comparing this with other infusions,
which had either been suffered to mould, from which
the tan had been extracted by jelly, or which had been kept
for some time at the boiling temperature, and by adding to
each of these respectively both the recent solution of the sulphate
of iron, and a solution which had been exposed for some
time to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>“The nature of the black compound produced was examined,
by putting portions of it into cylindrical jars and observing the
changes which they experienced with respect either to the formation
of mould, the deposition of their contents, or any
change of color. The fluids were also compared by dropping
portions of them upon white tissue paper, in which way both
their color and their consistence might be minutely ascertained.
A third method was to add together the respective infusions,
and the solutions of the sulphate of iron, in a very diluted state,
by which I was enabled to form a more correct comparison of
the quantity and of the shade of the coloring matter, and of the
degree of its solubility.</p>

<p>“The practical conclusions which I think myself warranted
in drawing from these experiments are as follows:—In order to
procure an ink which may be little disposed either to mould or
to deposit its contents, and which at the same time may possess
a deep black color not liable to fade, the galls
should be <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
macerated for some hours in hot water, and the fluid filtered; it
should then be exposed for about fourteen days to a warm atmosphere,
when any mould which may have been produced must
be removed. A solution of sulphate of iron is to be employed
which has been exposed for some time to the atmosphere, and
which consequently contains a certain quantity of the red oxide
diffused through it. I should recommend the infusion of galls
to be made of considerably greater strength than is generally
directed, and I believe that an ink formed in this manner will
not necessarily require the addition of any mucilaginous substance
to render it of a proper consistence.</p>

<p>“I have only farther to add, that one of the best substances
for diluting ink, if it be in the first instance too thick for use,
or afterwards become so by evaporation, is a strong decoction
of coffee, which appears in no respect to promote the decomposition
of the ink, while it improves its color and gives it
an additional lustre.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ure recommends the following formula for the manufacture
of writing ink. To make twelve gallons take: 12lb of
nutgalls; 5lb of green sulphate of iron; 5lb of gum Senegal;
12 gallons of water. The bruised nutgalls are to be put into a
cylindrical copper, of a depth equal to its diameter, and boiled
during three hours, with three-fourths of the above quantity of
water, taking care to add fresh water to replace what is lost by
evaporation. The decoction is to be emptied into a tub, allowed
to settle, and the clear liquor being drawn off, the lees
are to be drained. The gum is to be dissolved in a small quantity
of hot water, and the mucilage thus formed, being filtered,
it is added to the clear decoction. The sulphate of iron must
likewise be separately dissolved and well mixed with the above.
The color darkens by degrees, in consequence of the peroxidizement
of the iron, on exposing the ink to the action of the
air.</p>

<p>But ink affords a more durable writing when used in the
pale state, because its particles are then finer and penetrate the
paper more intimately. When ink consists
chiefly of tannate <span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
of peroxide of iron, however black, it is merely superficial,
and is easily erased or effaced. Therefore, whenever the liquid
made by the above prescription has acquired a moderately
deep tint, it should be drawn off clear into bottles and well
corked up. Some ink-makers allow it to mould a little in the
casks before bottling, and suppose that it will thereby be not
so liable to become mouldy in the bottles. A few bruised cloves
or other aromatic perfume, added to ink, is said to prevent the
formation of mouldiness, which is produced by the ova of infusoria
animalcules.</p>

<p>The ink made by this prescription is much more rich and
powerful than many of the inks commonly sold. To bring it
to the common standard a half more water may safely be added.
Even twenty gallons of tolerable ink may be made from
the above weight of materials.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>COTT’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">W<b>RITING</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—Mr. Scott’s method of manufacturing
writing ink, as patented by him in 1840, is as follows:—Take
48lb of logwood chips, and let them be saturated two days in
soft water, then put the same into a close covered iron cauldron,
and add 80 gallons of soft water; let these be boiled one
hour and a half, when the wood must be taken out and the
fluid left, to which add 48lb of the best picked Aleppo galls in
coarse powder; boil these half an hour longer, then draw off
the fire, and let it remain in the cauldron twenty-four hours
infusing, during which it is to be very frequently agitated;
when the properties of the galls are sufficiently extracted, draw
off the clear fluid into a vat, and add 40lb of pulverized sulphate
of iron; let these ingredients remain a week (stirring
daily), after which add four gallons of vinegar. Next take
<span class="nowrap">7&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>lb</span>
of the best picked gum arabic, and dissolve it in sufficient water
to form a good mucilage, which must be well strained, and
then added to the fluid by degrees; let these stand a few days
longer, when pour into the same 20 ounces of the concentrated
nitrate of iron; let the whole stand by again until it has arrived
at its height of blackness; next pour the clear fluid off
from the sediment, and add to it the following substances, each
prepared
and ground separately:― <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span></p>

<p>First, take half a pound of Spanish indigo, which grind very
fine between a muller and stone, adding by degrees portions
of the ink until it is made into an easy soluble paste; next take
well-washed and purified Prussian blue five pounds, which
prepare as the former, except grinding it in distilled water in
lieu of the fluid, until it is formed into a soluble paste; also
next take four ounces of gas black which results from the
smoke of gas burners received on surfaces of glass, as is well
known, which grind in one ounce of the nitrate of iron; when
each is sufficiently fine, let them remain a few hours unmixed,
when the whole may be incorporated with the fluid, and kept
agitated daily for a week. The clear may then be poured off
for use. The above will make eighty gallons of ink.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D<b>R.</b></span>
<span class="smcap">N<b>ORMANDY’S</b></span>
<span class="smcap">B<b>LACK</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—In order to supersede the
use of nutgalls, Dr. Normandy patented the following process
for making black ink:―</p>

<p>Take either sumach, elm wood, elder, chestnut, beech, willow,
oak, plum, sycamore, cherry, poplar wood, catechu, or
any other wood or berry, or extract of vegetable substances,
containing gallic acid and tannin, or either, and put this, previously
reduced to powder, into a copper full of common water,
and boil it until a sufficiently strong decoction be obtained.</p>

<p>The quantity of water must of course vary according to the
sort of vegetable substance employed; catechu, for example,
requiring less water than sumach, on account of the former
being almost totally soluble. To this add a certain quantity
of Campeachy wood, of acetate and hydrate of deutoxide of
copper, of sulphate of alumina and potash, of sulphate of protoxide
of iron, in quantities which vary also according to the
vegetable material first employed, and gum arabic, or the best
sort of gum Senegal, in the proportion of eighty pounds or
thereabouts for 340 gallons of liquid; also a variable quantity
of sulphate of indigo; the whole of these last ingredients, depending
on the shade of the color intended to be produced, it
is impossible to indicate absolutely the proportions in which
they are to be used, as the taste and fancy of
the operator must <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
decide. Supposing, however, a blue black to be the color desired,
and sumach, for example, the vegetable ingredient selected
for the purpose, the proportions should be for 240 gallons:
sumach, from 12 to 15 sacks, of four bushels each; Campeachy
logwood, 2 cwt. or thereabouts, according as new or
old chip is used; gum arabic, <span class="nowrap">80 lb.</span>
to 1 cwt.; sulphate of protoxide
of iron, 1 cwt.; acetate and hydrate of deutoxide of copper,
4lb; sulphate of alumina and potash, 37lb; sulphate of indigo,
6lb, or even more, according to the intensity of the blue cast
desired. If catechu were to be used instead of sumach, 1 cwt.
would be required, the proportions of the other materials remaining
the same.</p>

<p>The variously colored precipitates which salts of iron form
in the solutions of the above-cited vegetable astringent substances,
all of which precipitates vary from the green to the
brown (the decoction of nutgalls yeilding with salts of iron only a
dark purple,) are the obstacles which have hitherto prevented the
use of these vegetable substances, with a view to supersede
nutgalls; but by means of the sulphate of indigo in various
proportions, from the above-cited substances a liquid may be
obtained, of different shades of color, from dark blue to most
intense black, applicable to dyeing, staining, or writing, and
which may be used with every description of pen.</p>

of coarse flannel, on one pound of hydrate or acetate of deutoxide

a piece of sponge is placed), then add immediately 14lbs. of

<p>One hundred-weight of the shells of chestnuts broken into
small pieces is to be immersed in about 180 or 200 quarts of
water, in a vessel of copper or any other material, except iron, and
after having been allowed to soak in this water for about 12 hours,
the material is then to be boiled for about three hours, in order to
obtain the extract. The wood of the chestnut tree may be cut into
small pieces or shaved thin, and treated in the same way.</p>

<p>The extract is now to be drawn off from the boiler, and filtered
through a fine sieve or cloth, after which the water must
be evaporated from it until the extract is reduced to the consistence
of paste.</p>

<p>It may now be cut into cakes of any convenient size, and
dried in an oven of low temperature, and when hard, may be
packed for sale, and used for any of the purposes in the arts
to which gallnuts have been heretofore applied. The quantity
of damajavag obtained from the above will be about 8 or
<span class="nowrap">10 lbs.</span></p>

<p>In using this damajavag, it is only necessary to pound or
otherwise reduce it to powder when it may be mixed with
other ingredients as pulverized gall nuts.</p>

<p>The same chemical properties belong to the sap of the chestnut-tree,
which may be extracted by tapping the trunk, and
when so obtained, may be used for the same purpose as gallnuts.</p>

<span class="smcap">B<b>LUE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—Stephens’ blue ink is prepared as
follows:—Take Prussian blue, whether produced from a combination
of prussiate of potash and salts of iron,
or the Prussian <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span>
blue of commerce, as commonly manufactured, and put this
into an earthen vessel, and pour over it a quantity of strong
acid, sufficient to cover the Prussian blue. Muriatic acid, sulphuric
acid, or any other acid which has a sufficient action upon
iron will do. If sulphuric acid is used it should be diluted a
little, that is, with a quantity of water equal to about its bulk. The
Prussian blue is allowed to remain in the acid from twenty-four
to forty-eight hours or longer, and then the mixture is diluted
with a large quantity of water, stirring it up at the time,
for the purpose of washing from it the salts of iron. When in
this state of dilution, it is allowed to stand until the color has
subsided, when the supernatant liquor is drawn off with a
syphon and more water added to it. This process is repeated
until the acid, with the iron, has been completely washed away,
which is known by testing it with prussiate of potash,
which will show if it yields any blue precipitate; if not, it is
sufficiently washed. The product is then placed upon a filter,
and suffered to remain until the liquid has all drained away.</p>

<p>The Prussian blue, thus prepared, is reduced to a state containing
less iron than the Prussian blue of commerce, in which
state it is more readily acted upon, and rendered soluble than
in any other condition.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>This Prussian blue may then be placed in evaporating dishes,
and gently dried. To form the Prussian blue, so operated
upon, into a solution, oxalic acid is added, and carefully mixed
with it, after which cold water is added (cold distilled water is
best) a little at a time, making it into a dense or dilute solution,
according to the color required. The quantity of oxalic
acid may vary according to the quantity of water used. It will
be found that the Prussian blue that has undergone the process
of digestion, as described, requires but a small quantity of
oxalic acid to dissolve it: about one part of oxalic acid will dissolve
six parts of Prussian blue, the weight taken before digesting
in the acid. This will answer for a concentrated solution,
but for a dilute solution more acid will be required.</p>

<span class="smcap">Q<b>UINIDINE.</b></span></h4>—Sulphate of quinidine
is advertised, “eo nomine,” for sale in the London Journals. What
we get, as yet, occurs only as an adulteration of the sulphate of
quinine. The same virtues, and to an equal extent, are ascribed by
the advertisers to the new article, that are possessed by quinine.
We do not know what authority there is for this statement, but it is
exceedingly desirable that careful and well conducted experiments
should be made to determine the properties and relative value of
quinidine, quinoidine, and cinchonine. The great importance of quinine
and its immense and constantly increasing consumption, long ago created
a well founded anxiety lest the sources whence we obtain it should
become exhausted or materially diminished. If the allied alkaloids will
in any degree replace it, it is a fact of the highest value. Quinidine,
in particular, is contained in some varieties of bark in which little
or no quinine is found, and if the statements which have been made of
the identity of its effects with quinine, probably without any better
foundation than the closeness of resemblance of the two substances,
should prove correct, the destruction of the cinchona Calisaya which is
going on, may be in some measure stayed.</div>

It was very little soluble in water, much more so in alcohol, and completely so
in diluted sulphuric acid. From chemical examination it would appear to contain
about 46 per cent of quinine, with perhaps traces of quinidine and cinchonine.
At the price at which we hear it is offered it will be sought for by the

<span class="smcap">A<b>LOINE.</b></span></h4>—Our readers will recollect that Dr. Pereira has found Aloine, the
chrystalline neutral principle recently discovered in Barbadoes aloes, by Mr.
Smith of Edinburgh, in Socotorine aloe juice, (New York Journal of Pharmacy,
No. 6, p. 177.) Since then Mr. Smith has succeeded in procuring it from Socotorine
aloes. It was much longer in crystallizing than when obtained from Barbadoes
aloes, but did so at last. When the impure product is recrystallized from rectified
spirits it presents the same appearance as the purified crystal of Barbadoes
aloes (the crystals obtained by Dr. Pereira which were spontaneously deposited
from the juice, were much smaller) and seems identical with that substance. It
has not yet been obtained from Cape aloes, but undoubtedly exists in that substance,
though probably from its inferior activity in much smaller quantity.</div>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>Aloine has been introduced into the practice of medicine in Edinburgh, and the
Messrs. Smith have already (June) sold a quarter of a hundred weight of it. It is
five times more active than good aloes—a single grain producing all the effect
of a large aloetic pill; the Edinburgh physicians describe it as acting “<i>tuto, cito,
et jucunde</i>,” safely, speedily, and pleasantly. If this is meant altogether seriously,
in the second of the char­ac­ter­is­tics it presents a marked contrast with the crude
drug. From the convenience with which it may be exhibited, it bids fair to
come into general and extensive use.</p>

<i>Action of Sulphuric Acid on the insoluble residue left by
Opium, exhausted by water. Formation of a new Alkaloid,
by</i> M. <span class="smcap">S<b>TANISLAS</b></span> <span
class="smcap">M<b>ARTIN</b>.</span></h4>—The smallest object added to a
kaleidoscope produces new shades and different images; so it is <span
class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span> with vegetable chemistry; every
practical man knows that a foreign body, an hours delay in executing
a work already commenced, changes the nature of the products. Two
experiments on the inert residue of opium, exhausted by water give
another illustration of this truth.</div>

<p>The residue of opium submitted to fermentation, affords us a substance which
has a great analogy to paramorphia; this substance has since been studied by
M. A. Guergy. The account of the labor of that chemist has been reproduced
in the review of the Journal de Pharmacie, 1849.</p>

<p>Our second operation consists in treating the residue of opium exhausted by
water, with water acidulated with sulphuric acid. The result is the formation
of an alkali which has many of the chemical properties of narcotine, but which
differs from it completely by its insolubility in ether.</p>

<p>This alkali has no relation with codeine or narceine; besides we obtain an
extractive matter, soluble in all proportions in water, to which it communicates
the property of frothing like soap.</p>

<p>The following is the method of proceeding. The residue of opium, exhausted
with water, is boiled in distilled water acidulated with sulphuric acid, after ten
minutes ebullition it has the appearance of a thick magma; it is strained with
strong expression; when the colature is cold it is filtered through paper.</p>

<p>The colature is highly colored; its odor is similar to that of opium, its taste is
exceedingly bitter.</p>

<p>Ammonia is added until litmus paper is no longer altered; the liquid is filtered,
the precipitate washed with distilled water, and permitted to dry; afterwards
it is boiled with a sufficient quantity of rectified alcohol and again filtered. The
alcoholic solution deposits on cooling, numerous needle like crystals, colored by
a brownish bitter resin. It is purified in the ordinary manner.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>What are the therapeutic properties of this alkaloid, of the extractive saponaceous
matter, and of the brown bitter resin! Do they partake of the properties
of opium? We know not; the physician alone can determine their value.—<i>Bulletin

The tincture being examined but a short time since, was found to be
gelatinized, as is generally the case with old tincture of kino. Having
never seen such a change before, I sought information, and ascertained
through the United States Dispensatory that a French Pharmaceutist
in Paris has remarked the same phenomenon, What is the cause of this
remarkable change, attended as it is, with the loss of astringency?
Is it not, perhaps, caused by the same action which produces peculiar
exudation from the bark of certain trees possessed of tannin,
retaining it for a <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span> while
and afterwards, when cut up in logs, losing their tanning properties
and exuding a species of ulmine? Is it not the same process which

especially can explain how to prevent this change, you will much oblige
myself and numerous readers.</div>

<p class="padtopc">This action was brought to recover damages from the defendant
for negligently putting up, labelling and selling as and
for the extract of <i>dandelion</i>, which is a simple and harmless
medicine, a jar of the extract of <i>belladonna</i>, which is a deadly
poison; by means of which the plaintiff, Mary Ann Thomas,
to whom, being sick, a dose of dandelion was prescribed by a
physician, and a portion of the contents of the jar was administered
as and for the extract of dandelion, was greatly injured,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The facts proved were briefly these: Mrs. Thomas being in
ill health, her physician prescribed for her a dose of dandelion.
Her husband purchased what was believed to be the medicine
prescribed, at the store of Dr. Foord, a physician and druggist
in Cazenovia, Madison County, where the plaintiffs reside.</p>

<p>A small quantity of the medicine thus purchased, was administered
to Mrs. Thomas, on whom it produced very alarming
effects; such as coldness of the surface and extremities,
feebleness of circulation, spasms of the muscles, giddiness of the
head, dilation of the pupils of the eyes, and derangement of
mind. She recovered, however, after some time, from its effects,
although, for a short time, her life was thought
to be in <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span>
great danger. The medicine administered was <i>belladonna</i>,
and not dandelion.</p>

<p>The jar from which it was taken was labelled
<i><span class="nowrap">“½lb.</span> Dandelion,
prepared by A. Gilbert, No. 108 John Street, N. Y.
Jar 8.02</i>.” It was sold for, and delivered by Dr. Foord, to be
the extract of dandelion as labelled. Dr. Foord purchased the
article as the extract of dandelion, from James S. Aspinwall, a
druggist at New York. Aspinwall bought it of the defendant
as extract of dandelion, believing it to be such.</p>

<p>The defendant was engaged at No. 108 John Street, New
York, in the manufacture and sale of certain vegetable extracts
for medicinal purposes, and in the purchase and sale of others.
The extracts manufactured by him were put up in jars for sale,
and those which he purchased, were put up by him in like
manner. The jars containing extracts manufactured by himself,
and those containing extracts purchased by him from
others, were labelled alike. Both were labelled like the jar in
question, as “prepared by A. Gilbert.” Gilbert was a person
employed by the defendant, at a salary, as an assistant in his
business. The jars were labelled in Gilbert’s name because he
had been previously engaged in the same business, on his own
account, at No. 108 John Street, and probably because Gilbert’s
labels rendered the articles more saleable. The extract
contained in the jar sold to Aspinwall, and by him to Foord,
was not manufactured by the defendant, but was purchased
by him from another manufacturer or dealer. The extract of
dandelion and the extract of belladonna resemble each other in
color, consistence, smell and taste, but may, on careful examination,
be distinguished, the one from the other, by those who
are well acquainted with these articles. Gilbert’s labels were
paid for by Winchester, and used in his business, with his
knowledge and assent.</p>

<p>The defendant’s counsel moved for a nonsuit on the following
grounds:―</p>

<p>1. That the action could not be sustained, as the defendant
was the remote vender of the article in question,
and there was <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
no connexion, transaction, or privity between him and the
plaintiffs, or either of them.</p>

<p>2. That this action sought to charge the defendant with the
consequences of the negligence of Aspinwall and Foord.</p>

<p>3. That the plaintiffs were liable to, and chargeable with the
negligence of Aspinwall and Foord, and therefore could not
maintain this action.</p>

<p>4. That according to the testimony Foord was chargeable
with negligence, and that the plaintiffs therefore could not sustain
this suit against the defendant; if they could sustain a suit
at all, it would be against Foord only.</p>

<p>5. That this suit, being brought for the benefit of the wife,
and alleging her as the meritorious cause of action, cannot be
sustained.</p>

<p>6. That there was not sufficient evidence of negligence in the
defendant to go to the jury.</p>

<p>The Judge overruled the motion for a nonsuit, and the defendant’s
counsel excepted.</p>

<p>The Judge, among other things, charged the jury that if they
should find from the evidence that either Aspinwall or Foord
were guilty of negligence in vending as and for dandelion the
extract taken by Mrs. Thomas, or that the plaintiff Thomas, or
those who administered it to Mrs. Thomas, were chargeable
with negligence in administering it, the plaintiffs were not entitled
to recover; but if they were free from negligence, and if
the defendant Winchester was guilty of negligence in putting
up and vending the extracts in question, the plaintiffs were entitled
to recover, provided the extract administered to Mrs.
Thomas was the same which was put up by the defendant and
sold by him to Aspinwall, and by Aspinwall to Foord.</p>

<p>That if they should find the defendant liable, the plaintiffs
in this action were entitled to recover damages only for the personal
injury and suffering of the wife, and not for loss of service,
medical treatment, or expense to the husband, and that
the recovery should be confined to the actual damages suffered
by the wife. <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span></p>

<p>The action was properly brought in the name of the husband
and wife, for the personal injury and suffering of the wife, and
the case was left to the jury, with the proper directions on that
point. <i>1 Chitty on Pleadings. 62 ed. of 1828.</i></p>

<p>The case depends on the first point taken by the defendant
on his motion for a nonsuit; and the question is whether the
defendant, being a remote vender of the medicine, and there
being no privity or connexion between him and the plaintiffs,
the action can be maintained.</p>

<p>If in labelling a poisonous drug with the name of a harmless
medicine for public market, no duty was violated by the defendant,
excepting that which he owed to Aspinwall, his immediate
vender, in virtue of his contract of sale, this action cannot
be maintained. If A build a wagon and sell it to B, who sells
it to C, and C hires it to D, who, in consequence of the gross
negligence of A in building the wagon, is overturned and injured.
D cannot recover damages against A, the builder.—A’s
obligation to build the wagon faithfully, arises solely out of
his contract with B. The public have nothing to do with it.
Misfortune to third persons, not parties to the contract, would
not be a natural and necessary consequence of the builder’s negligence;
and such negligence is not an act immediately dangerous
to human life.</p>

<p>So for the same reason, if a horse be defectively shod by a
smith, and a person hiring the horse from the owner is thrown
and injured in consequence of the smith’s negligence in shoeing,
the smith is not liable for the injury. The smith’s duty in
such case grows exclusively out of his contract with the owner
of the horse; it was a duty which the smith owed him alone,
and to no one else. And, although the injury to the rider may
have happened in consequence of the negligence of the smith,
the latter was not bound, either by his contract or by any considerations
of public policy or safety, to respond for his breach
of duty to any one except the person he contracted with.</p>

<p>This was the ground on which the case of <i>Winterbotham
vs. Wright. 10 Mees and Wellsby, 109</i>,
was decided. A <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
contracted with the Post Master General to provide a coach to
convey the mail bags along a certain line of road, and B and
others also contracted to horse the coach along the same line.
B and his co-contractors hired C, who was the plaintiff, to
drive the coach. The coach, in consequence of some latent defect,
broke down; the plaintiff was thrown from his seat, and
lamed. It was held that C could not maintain an action against
A for the injury thus sustained. The reason of the decision is
best stated by Baron Rolfe. A’s duty to keep the coach in
good condition was a duty to the Post Master General, with
whom he made his contract, and not a duty to the driver employed
by the owners of the horses.</p>

<p>But the case in hand stands on a different ground. The defendant
was a dealer in poisonous drugs. Gilbert was his agent
in preparing them for market; the death, or great bodily harm
of some person was the natural and almost inevitable consequence
of the sale of belladonna by means of the false label.—Gilbert,
the defendant’s agent, would have been punishable for
manslaughter if Mrs. Thomas had died in consequence of taking
the falsely labelled medicine. Every man who, by his culpable
negligence, causes the death of another, although without
intent to kill, is guilty of manslaughter. 2 <i>R. S.</i> 662. § 19.
A chemist who negligently sells laudanum in a phial labelled
as paregoric, and thereby causes the death of a person to whom
it is administered, is guilty of manslaughter. <i>Tessymond’s
case, 1 Lewins’ crown cases, 169.</i> “So highly does the law
value human life that it admits of no justification wherever life
has been lost, and the carelessness or negligence of one person
has contributed to the death of another.” <i>Regina vs. Swindall,
2 Car. and Kir. 232–3.</i> And this rule applies not only where
the death of one is occasioned by the negligent act of another,
but where it is caused by the negligent omission of a duty of
that other. <i>2 Car. and Kir. 368–371.</i> Although the defendant
Winchester may not be answerable, criminally, for the negligence
of his agent, there can be no doubt of his liability in
a civil action, in which the act of the agent is
to be regarded <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span>
as the act of the principal. In respect to the wrongful and
criminal character of the negligence complained of, this case
differs widely from those put by the defendant’s counsel. No
such imminent danger existed in those cases.</p>

<p>In the present case the sale of the poisonous article was
made to a dealer in drugs, and not to a consumer. The injury,
therefore, was not likely to fall on him, or on his vendee who
was also a dealer; but much more likely to be visited on a remote
purchaser, as actually happened. The defendant’s negligence
put human life in imminent danger. Can it be said that
there was no duty on the part of the defendant to avoid the
creation of that danger by the exercise of greater caution. Or,
that the exercise of that caution was a duty only to his immediate
vendee, whose life was not endangered? The defendant’s
duty arose out of the nature of his business, and the danger to
others incident to its mismanagement. Nothing but mischief
like that which actually happened could have been expected
from sending the poison falsely labelled into the market; and
the defendant is justly responsible for the propable consequences
of the act.</p>

<p>The duty of exercising caution in this respect did not arise
out of the defendant’s contract of sale to Aspinwall. The
wrong done by the defendant was in putting the poison mislabelled
into the hands of Aspinwall, as an article of merchandize
to be sold and afterwards used as the extract of <i>dandelion</i>
by some person then unknown. The owner of a horse and
cart, who leaves them unattended in the street, is liable for any
damage which may result from his negligence. <i>Lynch vs.
Mordon, 1 ad. and Ellis, U. S. 29, 5 Car. and Payne 190.</i>
<i>Illidge vs. Goodwin.</i> The owner of a loaded gun, who puts
it into the hands of a child by whose indiscretion it is
discharged, is liable for the damage occasioned by the discharge.
<i>5 Maule and Sel. 198.</i> The defendant’s contract of sale to Aspinwall
does not excuse the wrong done to plaintiffs. It was a
part of the means by which the wrong was effected. The plaintiffs
injury and their remedy would have stood
on the same <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
principle, if the defendant had given the <i>belladonna</i> to Dr.
Foord without price; or, if he had put it in his shop without
his knowledge, under circumstances which would propably
have led to its sale, on the faith of the label.</p>

<p>In <i>Longmead vs. Holliday, 6 Law and Eq. Rep. 562</i>, the
distinction is recognized between an act of negligence imminently
dangerous to the lives of others, and one that is not so.
In the former case, the party guilty of the negligence is liable
to the party injured, whether there be a contract between them
or not; in the latter, the negligent party is liable only to the
party with whom he contracted, and on the ground that negligence
is a breach of the contract.</p>

<p>The defendant on the trial insisted that Aspinwall and Foord
were guilty of negligence in selling the article in question for
what it was represented to be in the label; and that the suit if
it could be sustained at all, should have been brought against
Foord. The judge charged the jury that if they or either of them
were guilty of negligence in selling the <i>belladonna</i> for <i>dandelion</i>,
the verdict must be for the defendant, and left the question
of their negligence to the jury, who found on that point for the
plaintiff. If the case really depended on the point thus raised,
the question was properly left to the jury. But, I think it did
not. The defendant by affixing the label to the jar represented
its contents to be <i>dandelion</i>, and to have been “prepared” by
his agent Gilbert. The word “prepared” on the label must be
understood to mean that the article was manufactured by him,
or that it had passed through some process under his hand,
which would give him personal knowledge of its true name
and quality. Whether Foord was justified in selling the article
upon the faith of the defendant’s label, would have been an
open question in an action by the plaintiffs against him; and I
wish to be understood as giving no opinion on that point. But
it seems to me to be clear, that the defendant cannot in this
case set up as a defence that Foord sold the contents of the jar
as and for what the defendant represented it to be. The label
conveyed the idea distinctly to Foord that the
contents of the <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
jar was the extract of <i>dandelion</i>, and that the defendant knew
it to be such. So far as the defendant is concerned, Foord was
under no obligation to test the truth of the representation.
The charge of the judge in submitting to the jury the question
in relation to the negligence of Foord and Aspinwall, cannot
be complained of by the defendant.</p>

<span class="smcap">A<b>ERE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>ICCO.</b></span></h4>—I take occasion again to
notice these preparations, for the reason, that I perceive from
a note, by the Editor of this Journal, appended to an article
on “Cicuta,” &amp;c., in the last (September) number: that he
considers the extracts of Messrs. Tilden or Currie, superior to
the best English extracts he has seen. I think, however, that
on reflection, he will agree with me that those prepared by means
of a current of dried air—some of which so made have been imported
and used here—must particularly, when there is anything
volatile about them,—be superior to all others; indeed, so favorably
am I inclined to regard this process, that I think the profession,
medical and phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal, should <i>demand</i> its adoption
by those engaged in the business of preparing extracts; until
which is the case, I shall feel it incumbent upon me to use the
imported article, as I have been in the habit of doing. Moreover,
the relative virosity of the <i>narcotic plants</i>
of the <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
American and European continents are still in favor of the latter,
although, if recent researches are to be depended upon, the difference
is not so great as was supposed. Mr. Currie, I believe,
prepares some at least, if not all his extracts with imported
herbs, and in vacuo, and they are therefore the best made here;
but these are the <i>dried</i> herbs, and cannot afford as good an extract,
ceteris paribus, as when the fresh plant is used. The
English extracts of indigenous plants are, strictly speaking,
<i>inspissated juices</i>, according to the <i>London Pharmacopœia</i>.
The juice of a plant inspissated by air alone, and that quickly
too, must be tantamount in its properties to the fresh plant
whence obtained, so far as we are at present aware, or at least
to the same, dried in the same equally safe manner; wherefore,
I consider them preferable to all other preparations of the
family of Extracts.<a class="aftntanc"

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch25" id="fn25">25</a>
Mr. Canavan mistakes—the assertion was that the
Extract of Conium, prepared by Tilden or by Currie, was superior
to the best English Extract of that article we have seen, and a
comparison of the odor of the two articles, under the influence
of a little liquor potassae, will readily convince the observer
of its correctness. The question as to the other Extracts is one
of great interest, and we still believe it awaits a satisfactory
solution.—<span class="smcap">[E<b>D.</b>]</span></p></div>

<div class="divh4ord"><h4 class="h4runin nowrap">
<span class="smcap">S<b>ANGUINARINA.</b></span></h4>—Having been called upon to prepare some
of this article, I undertook to do so by the process said to have
been adopted by Mr. Dana, viz.: displacing the root with dilute
acetic acid; precipitating by ammonica; boiling with
purified animal charcoal; treating with alcohol, and finally
evaporating the alcoholic solution, by which I obtained from
two ounces of the root, about twenty grains only, having the
sensible properties of the article very strongly, and being of a
reddish brown color, assuming, when finely pulverized, an ochreish
hue. It has been described as a “white, pearly substance,”
which it might have become by more perfect discoloration, or
the use of a different acid. The liquor from which it was precipitated,
lost its peculiar taste, but not all its color, showing
that the color of the root does not depend altogether on this
principle, as was supposed. The article in question has been
used by one practitioner, who stated it to have met his expectations,
administered in doses of one sixth of a grain. The preparation
in question is a very desirable one, as the objectionable
taste of the ordinary preparations is a frequent bar to
their use.</div>

<div class="divh4ord"><h4 class="h4runin nowrap">
<span class="smcap">A<b>LOINE.</b></span></h4>—On this subject it may be well to
mark the fact, <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
that the officinal “ext. aloe purificat,” presents the active property
of the aloes, freed from its griping quality, (though this
is doubted; but the same doubt would seem to apply to aloine.)
It is, however, about twice the strength of the crude extract,
and is generally used when the “tuto cito et jucunde” effect is
desired. The change which is supposed to take place in the
aloine, from the heat used in the preparation of the purified
extract, would only—according to the Messrs. Smith of Edinburg—prevent
its cry­stal­li­za­tion, and therefore the extract
should be equally advantageous, except, perhaps, in regard of
bulk, which is not a very <i>great</i> object.</div>

<span class="smcap">Q<b>UINIDINE.</b></span></h4>—In
em­ploy­ing this test, some
mod­i­fi­ca­tion of the original directions is necessary, in order to
success. The word <i>drop</i> is used, but it is doubtful whether
<i>minim</i> may not be meant, and if not, the difference in density
of the liquids used would prevent our getting, by dropping,
the correct quantities. This I found to be the case, and to save
future trouble I give the minutiæ of the experiment as I performed
it, with success; no evidence of the presence of quinidine
being shown, as was expected:</div>

<p>In each instance, the drops were allowed to fall from the
lip of an ordinary quart tincture bottle, except the sulphuric
acid, which was contained in a small pint tincture bottle,
and of which I used <i>three times the number of drops</i> directed;
the drops being about one third the size of a drop of
distilled water, which was shown to be correct, by the necessity
for that quantity to effect a solution which took place without
the aid of external heat. With regard to this matter of
drops, it is a considerable eyesore. I would recommend to
apothecaries, (perhaps it might be deemed worthy of the action
of the convention), to agree upon some standard
<i>size</i> for the <span class="xxpn" id="p331">{331}</span>
drop,—say that of a drop of distilled water, under definite circumstances.
It is true, we have a measure; but it is for minims
not for drops, whilst in this way, by a little practice, the eye
might be accustomed to the proper size of the drop, so that
there would be little or no difficulty in obtaining an exact result,
by increasing or diminishing the number of drops, according
to the proportional size of its drop, to the standard one.
Of course, when I speak of “keeping the drop in the eye,” I
do not mean to imply anything incompatible with the Maine
Liquor Law. I speak aquatically, not <i>spiritually</i>.</p>

<h3>NATIONAL PHARMACEUTICAL CONVENTION.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>According to the arrangement which had previously been
announced, the National Convention met in Philadelphia, on
Wednesday the 6th of October, at 4 P. M. In the absence of
Dr. Guthrie, the President, the Convention was organized by
the appointment of Mr. Coggeshall, of New York, as President
<i>pro tempore</i>; Mr. A. B. Taylor, of Philadelphia, as acting Secretary.
A committee was then appointed by the Chair, consisting
of Messrs. Ellis, of Philadelphia, Colcord, of Boston, and Laidley,
of Richmond, to examine the credentials of the delegates
present; and to report a resolution in regard to the admission of
such apothecaries as might be present,
who, though not <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
delegated by any incorporated institution, desired to attend the
Convention.</p>

<p>The committee reported that satisfactory credentials had been
presented by the following gentlemen:―</p>

<p><i>From the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy</i>—Joseph
Burnett, Samuel M. Colcord, Dr. Samuel R. Philbrick.</p>

<p><i>From the College of Pharmacy, of the City of New York</i>—George
D. Coggeshall, L. S. Haskell, John Meakim.</p>

<p><i>From the Richmond Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Society</i>—Alexander
Duvall, John Purcell, Joseph Laidley.</p>

<p><i>From the Cincinnatti College of Pharmacy</i>—William B.
Chapman, Charles Augustus Smith, Edward S. Wayne.</p>

<p><i>From the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy-</i>-Daniel B.
Smith, Charles Ellis, William Procter, Jr.</p>

<p><i>From the Maryland College of Pharmacy</i>—Dr. David
Stewart, George W. Andrews.</p>

<p>Henry F. Fish, of Waterbury, Connecticut, as the representative
of the apothecaries and druggists of Hartford county,
Connecticut. The following resolution was also offered by the
committee:―</p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That those gentlemen whose interest in the object
of the Convention has induced them to meet with us on this
occasion, be invited to take seats in the Convention, and fully
participate in its proceedings.</p>

<p>The report and resolutions were adopted, and the committee
continued to act on claims of delegates, and others not yet
arrived.</p>

<p>After the roll had been called, the following gentlemen were
invited to seats in the convention, viz.:―</p>

<p>After the officers had taken their seats, the following report
was presented by the committee appointed at the Convention,
held the previous year at New York, “To act as a standing
committee, to collect such information as maybe deemed valuable,
together with memorials and suggestions from Medical and
Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Associations to be presented to the next Convention.”</p>

<p>“The undersigned, a committee appointed at the Convention, held
last year in New York, and instructed “To collect and receive such
information as may be valuable, and memorials and suggestions from
Medical and Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Associations, to be presented to the next
Convention,” respectfully report: That in the period that has elapsed
since their appointment—not­with­stand­ing the fact of their readiness to
receive any communications, having been duly announced—they have
received no contributions towards the end or object of their appointment,
except those relating to the inspection of drugs. They have,
however, not been unmindful of the duty imposed upon them, and now
offer the following suggestions, as tending to aid the business of the
Convention, in so far as they exhibit some of the more prominent
subjects, worthy of its serious deliberation and action.</p>

<p>1st, The number of phar­ma­ceu­tists constituting the professional
body in the United States is large, comprehends all grades of qualifications,
and extends to every city and town in the country. The professed
object of the present Convention being to adopt measures calculated
to benefit this large body of citizens, in a professional point of
view, by showing that there exist many grounds of sympathy between
them, not­with­stand­ing the present want of united action; we believe,
that the institution of a national association, whose members may come
from all sections of the body, is calculated to enlist
this feeling of <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
brotherhood, and direct its power, as a reforming force, towards the
elevation of the average standard of qualification now existing. In
view of this, it is suggested, whether the passage of a resolution by
this Convention, resolving itself into a National Association, should not
properly engage its attention at its commencement, so that the important
details of forming a Constitution—explaining the nature of its organization,
&amp;c. &amp;c., might receive the deliberate consideration they
merit, before being adopted.</p>

<p>As the basis upon which the Association will rest, will be the decision
as to what shall constitute a member, we believe its ultimate usefulness
will very much depend on the character of this decision, and
we cannot refrain from presenting some reflections on the subject.</p>

<p>The inefficiency or inadequacy of the present basis, viz.:—Delegates
from incorporated and unincorporated societies is here demonstrated,
by the small number who have been appointed in answer to the
call; at least, this must be true, so long as the process of local organization
is so dilatory. The aim should be, to enlist as much as possible
of the talent now engaged in the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal ranks.</p>

<p>We think, therefore, that membership in the proposed association
should be of a representative character, to as full an extent as practicable.
Colleges and societies of pharmacy should, of course, send
delegates. Then, provision should be made for the apothecaries, in
cities and towns where no society exists, whereby they may send representatives,
to the extent of one for every ten apothecaries, in such
places; each representative to bring with him a certificate from his
constituents. Finally, to provide for the admission of isolated individuals,
who may not have neighbors sufficient to entitle them to act as
representatives, but who feel an interest in the association. Power
should be given to the committee, on credentials, under certain
restrictions.</p>

<p>The formation of the constitution, and the preparation of a code of
ethics applicable to the present condition of the profession; sufficiently
stringent to elevate the members above many things now too prevalent,
and yet not so binding as to exclude a large number, who, though well
disposed, are unable to free themselves from participation in acts contrary
to the highest standard, without a sacrifice greater than could be
expected of them, should engage the wisest action of the Convention,
to render them practicable
in their working. <span class="xxpn" id="p335">{335}</span></p>

<p>2nd, The subject of <i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Education</i> is, in the opinion of
this committee, one of great importance, and deserving of the consideration
of the committee, in several points of view. Indeed, the
primary object of the Convention being called, was in reference to the
improvement of the standard practice throughout the country; and this
cannot be effected without extending the present means of education,
either by schools, or by an increase of facilities, offered by proprietors
to their apprentices and assistants. In too many instances the proprietors
are illy fitted to extend to those whom they have engaged to teach
the business of a Pharmaceutist the tuition that of right belongs to them.
As schools of pharmacy are of gradual growth, and cannot be expected
to exist, except in large cities, the Convention would do well to consider
what subsidiary means may be enlisted to reach those of our
brethren who reside in small towns. One of the first of these collateral
aids will be found in local organizations, embracing the proprietors
in such towns where, by a union of their exertions and contributions
they may encourage phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal literature, by forming libraries,
and uphold among themselves correct practice,—the employment only
of good drugs, and the receipt of fair prices.</p>

<p>In France, where but three phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal schools exist, there are
such societies in all large towns, which have halls and libraries,
where their young men and apprentices have opportunities for gaining
knowledge; and laboratories wherein they occasionally perform operations
not easily executed with the instruments and utensils most
usually found in shop laboratories. If such associations can be formed
by the proprietors, they will soon influence the apprentices, and thus
effect the object aimed at, to a great extent.</p>

<p>The superior advantages of tuition in well conducted schools of
pharmacy will not be doubted, especially, when it is preceded by several
years shop practice. Access to these, by young men at a distance,
can always be had, when their circumstances enable them to attend, and
thus finish their phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal education. The perfection of a
school of pharmacy is attained by attaching to it a practical laboratory,
wherein the advanced pupils can have an opportunity to become
familiar with the more difficult manipulations of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal chemistry,
and of extemporaneous pharmacy. As yet, neither of the
schools in this country have that addition, which arises from the fact,
that the expense of conducting them, renders their support
by the fees <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
of the pupils almost impossible. We think the voice of the Convention
should be raised to encourage the formation of such schools, and
also, to advocate the practice of preparing chemicals in the shop
laboratory.</p>

<p>3rd, The apprenticeship system, which obtains, in many parts of the
United States, is a subject worthy the consideration of the Convention.
The conditions, conducing to mutual advantage, between the employer
and the employed, are not sufficiently attended to in general. Proprietors
often do not consider the fitness of applicants, both as regards natural
endowments and preliminary education, with that care and attention
that a due regard to such applicants demands; and consequently,
a large number of inefficient apothecaries are entailed upon the country—inefficient
from lack of talent, or from disgust at a business for
which they have no inclination. More attention to the claims of apprentices,
on the <i>teaching</i> of their employers, should be advocated by
the Convention as due to the former, as advantageous to the latter, and
eventually to the profession.</p>

<p>4th, The committee believe that the subject of <i>secret medicines</i>, or
quackery, as applied to Pharmacy, together with the course usually
followed by quacks, in bringing their nostrums into notice, is becoming
yearly more fraught with ill consequences, both to the consumers
and the apothecaries, and merits the consideration of the Convention,
as to whether the reference of the subject to a committee to investigate,
would not result in some advantage.</p>

<p>5th, The subject of the <i>inspection of imported drugs</i>, as regards the
<i>actual</i> working of the law, is of deep interest to all. The possibility
of bringing the influence of this Convention to bear, in regard to the
continuance in office of able men, solely on the ground of fitness, is
worth consideration. The usefulness of this law rests absolutely on
the ability and cons­cien­tious­ness of the inspector, and if incumbents,
perfectly satisfactory to those concerned, are removed on political
grounds, and replaced by inexperienced and unqualified persons, it is
apparent that the good results of the law will cease.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the efficiency of the law against the importation
of inferior drugs, it will not reach those <i>at home</i>, who are disposed to
resort to adulteration as a means of increasing their profits. The power
of the General Government ceases with the Custom House. It will
be necessary in order to reach this evil effectually, as far as
it can be <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
done by legislation; to induce our State Legislatures and Municipal
Authorities to authorize some form of inspection by which the delinquents
can be reached; not the drug adulterator merely, but the medicine
adulterator—the apothecary who scruples not to reduce the
strength of standard medicines, that he may reduce his prices. Whatever
may be the proper course of this Convention, we believe that eventually
the National Association should urge, with all the force of its influence,
the enactment of State laws tending to the reformation of
these evils.</p>

<p>6th, The general adoption of our <i>National Pharmacopœia</i> as a guide
in the preparation of officinal medicines, is much to be desired. We
believe that this Convention should encourage its adoption, and should
request the publishers of that work to issue a small sized cheap edition,
so that every physician and apothecary shall have a copy. We
also believe that a fruitful source of variation in the preparations of
the shops, is the existence of a number of formulæ for the same preparation,
as found in the British Pharmacopœias parallel with that of
our own code, in the commentaries in general use.</p>

<p>7th, The <i>indiscriminate sale of poisons</i> by druggists and apothecaries,
as at present conducted, is a serious evil in the United States.
Any views which may originate in the Convention, tending to abate
this evil, would no doubt have some influence, if circulated by its
authority.</p>

<p>8th, The separation of Pharmacy from the practice of Medicine,
has long been effected on the continent of Europe, by the direct interference
of the government, each profession being in the hands of a distinct
class of men. Inheriting, as we do, our medical institutions
from Great Britain, the confusion of interests which has long prevailed
there has in some measure descended to us; and many instances
of medical practitioners conducting apothecary shops, like the so-called
<i>apothecaries</i> of England, exist among us. The increase of this class
in some localities has been marked of late years—a fact attributable
to the “undue multiplication of graduates in medicine, who, finding the
ranks of their profession so full as to render prospect of immediate
success doubtful, turn their attention towards Pharmacy, as a subsidiary
means of support. As these mongrel apothecaries too frequently
use their shops merely as stepping-stones to business, they tend directly
to depreciate the standard of practice on the one
hand, and tempt <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span>
young apothecaries, who are struggling against the difficulties of an
already excessive competition, to turn their attention to medical practice
with or without a diploma, as may suit their circumstances or fancy,
on the other, and thus complicate the confusion. As pharmacy never
will advance as it should, whilst this amalgamation exists in cities and
towns to any large extent, we earnestly recommend to this Convention,
that a voice may go forth at its present session, calling attention
to this growing evil.</p>

<p>9th, Believing, that if the Phar­ma­ceu­tists of the United States are
true to themselves, the Meetings of the Association, of which the present
may be considered the beginning, will annually increase in interest
and importance, we would suggest—what must have occurred to
many present—that they should be partially devoted to the advancement
of Pharmacy, as well as to the sciences on which it is based, by
inviting contributions of original papers, and by committing subjects
requiring investigation to suitable committees, who should report the
results of their researches at the ensuing Annual Meeting, when,
if they meet the approbation of the Association, it might direct their
publication. Participation in the proceedings of such a gathering of
their brethren, would prove a powerful incentive to many phar­ma­ceu­tists,
whose tastes lead them into scientific paths, to cultivate their talents
by the pursuit of investigations fraught with usefulness to their
profession at home, and with honor to it abroad.</p>

<p>And lastly, whatever may be the ultimate action of the Convention,
in relation to the subjects brought forward in this Report, we would
respectfully suggest that a full digest of its proceedings be directed to
be published, and largely circulated among the Phar­ma­ceu­tists of the
United States, as calculated to do much good.</p>

<p>President in the chair.</p>

<p>On the roll being called, the delegates
generally were present. <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span></p>

<p>The minutes of the preceding sitting were read and adopted.</p>

<p>The President informed the Convention, that the Business
Committee not being ready to report, it was understood that
Dr. Stewart, Examiner of Drugs, &amp;c., at the port of Baltimore,
had some statements to offer in regard to the working of
the Drug Law at that port, and the Convention assenting, requested
him to proceed.</p>

<p>Dr. Stewart stated, that as there had been some difference
of opinion among the Drug Examiners, as to the intention of
the law in certain cases, he desired the opinion of the Convention
regarding the inferior class of Cinchona Barks that came
from Maracaibo, Carthagena, &amp;c., and other articles about
which there is difference of opinion among druggists. In illustration
of the difficulties of the subject, he remarked that one
invoice of bark, that in a commercial point of view was not esteemed,
and which came invoiced at ten cents per pound, had
yielded, on analysis, two and a half per cent of cinchonine;
whilst Loxa bark, invoiced at thirty cents per pound, had afforded
but a fraction of one per cent. He considered the admission
of the barks in question as quite different from deteriorated
or adulterated drugs, in as much as they possessed a
range of power which, though inferior to the best Peruvian
barks, was yet useful, and capable of application in medicine.</p>

<p>He therefore offered the following resolution:</p>

<p>“Resolved, that it is the opinion of this Convention, that all
varieties of drugs, that are good of their kind, should be admitted
by the Special Examiners of drugs and medicines.”</p>

<p>Pending the consideration of this resolution, Mr. Coggeshall
informed the Convention that Dr. Bailey, the Special Examiner
of Drugs for the port of New York, had furnished, at his request,
a report on the character of imported drugs, coming under
his supervision, and on the general working of the laws,
which, by request, was read. (Published in our last.)</p>

<p>A similar report from Mr. Edward Hamilton, late Drug Examiner
at the port of Boston, communicated to Mr. S. M.
Colcord, at his request, with a view to its
being presented to <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span>
this Convention, was also read. (To be published in our next.)</p>

<p>Dr. Stewart then opened the debate on the subject, arguing
that drugs, of whatever virtue or variety, so that they are good
of their kind, should be admitted. In reference to Barks he
could say, that perhaps a larger amount of the varieties of that
drug came to the port of Baltimore than any other. That the
merchants in that trade were so desirous of getting the best
kinds, that it was quite usual for them to import specimens by
way of the Isthmus, and have them examined before ordering
their invoices, to ascertain whether they would pass the Custom-house,
that he had, (as Examiner at that port,) chemically
examined a large number of samples of the barks, both Peruvian
and Carthagena, and that the latter had invariably contained
more or less of alkaloids, and were generally of good
quality, of their kind.</p>

<p>He therefore considered the fact that a drug is, or may be
used as an adulteration for other drugs, should not exclude it
if it is used to any extent on its own merits. In illustration,
Dr. Stewart remarked that the Examiner might go on a vessel
and observe, side by side, two casks of oil, consigned to the
same individual, one invoiced “cod liver oil,” and the other
“sperm oil.” On examination he finds that they are what
they purport to be; the suspicion would arise very naturally,
that the latter was to be used for adulterating the former, yet,
should sperm oil be excluded, because certain parties use it for
an adulteration? He thought not, and on the same grounds
he considered that the inferior barks and rhubarb should be
admitted, although some persons may use them for adulteration.</p>

<p>At the request of the President, Professor Carson, of the
University of Pennsylvania, addressed the Convention on the
subject before it. He coincided generally with the views of
Dr. Stewart, as regarded the value of the drugs in question.
He expressed the opinion that numerous varieties of the so-called
Carthagena and Maracaibo barks, were possessed of decided
medicinal virtue; that several kinds
of European rhubarb <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
were of much value in medicine, especially in times when the
officinal varieties are scarce, and that these drugs should all
be admitted, when not deteriorated or adulterated.</p>

<p>Mr. Haskell, of New York, advocated the same views, more
especially, as related to English rhubarb, bringing forward the
testimony of Dr. Pereira, to the effect, that some specimens
of Banbury rhubarb were almost, if not fully equal to the Chinese
drug, and they were here even of rather higher price.
He also stated, that a large demand existed in this country for
the yellow Carthagena barks, that the House, of which he
Was a member, sold large quantities in powder, and that the
parties purchasing it did so, knowing its origin. He was not
aware of the use to which it was put, but presumed that it was
employed legitimately.</p>

<p>Mr. Fisk, of Connecticut, stated, that through the part of
New England that he represented, considerable quantities of
the barks in question were used legitimately, as tonics; and
that no instance of their being used as an adulteration of the
Peruvian barks had come to his knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. Coggeshall on the other side of the question, called the
attention of the Convention to the item in Dr. Bailey’s Report,
showing that three hundred thousand pounds of these barks
had been rejected at the port of New York, in about two years
and a half. He argued that this bark was not consumed there;
that it was not used in the manufacture of the alkaloids; that
the allegation that it was used for making tooth powders would
hardly account for the great consumption of it, and the question
naturally arose for what purpose was it imported? He
believed that it was used extensively to grind with the
Peruvian barks, as an adulteration, and to make an inferior
extract, which could be done cheaply and profitably, and
it was largely sold as an officinal preparation, that many of
the persons who came to our cities to buy drugs, were not able
to judge of their purity, and bought them without asking any
questions, save, as regarded price,—and so convinced was he
of the application of these false barks to
these false purposes, <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
that as a protective measure, in his opinion, they should be excluded.
And also, in regard to English and other European
rhubarb, that the argument of Professor Carson would not hold
good while the markets were so well supplied with the Russian
and Chinese varieties, to which the Banbury, regarded as the
best of the European, was so very inferior. It might be used
as a dernier resort, but should only be so used. Entirely independent
of this argument, however, Mr. Coggeshall considered
that European rhubarb should be excluded, because of its peculiar
adaptation and general use as an adulteration, owing to its
fine color, which enables the adulterator to improve the appearance
of the inferior Chinese variety, to mix it with the Russian
article in powder, without depreciating its appearance; or, as it
is notoriously done, to a great extent, substitute it entirely for
the true article.</p>

<p>Mr. Colcord, of Boston, advocated the latter view, and hoped
that the Resolution would not pass.</p>

<p>Other members of the Convention joined in the debate, after
which, the question was taken on the Resolution of Dr. Stewart,
and it was lost.</p>

<p>As the importance of the subject introduced by Dr. Stewart,
was fully appreciated by the Convention, at the same time that
no direct course of action seemed proper for it to pursue,
the following Resolution was offered by Mr. Smith, of Cincinnati,
viz.:</p>

<p>“Resolved, that the whole subject of the Inspection of Drugs
shall be referred to a Committee, who shall be instructed to
confer with the Examiners, and endeavor to arrive at some
practicable means of fixing standards for imported drugs.”</p>

<p>The resolution was unanimously adopted, and Mr. Taylor, of
Philadelphia, Mr. Meakim, of New York, and Mr. Burnett, of
Boston, were appointed by the President, to carry it into effect.</p>

<p>On motion of Mr. Procter, Dr. Stewart, of Baltimore, was
added to the Committee.</p>

<h3>OBSERVATIONS UPON A GENERAL METHOD
FOR DETECTING THE ORGANIC ALKALOIDS
IN CASES OF POISONING.
<span class="hsmall">
BY PROFESSOR STAS, OF BRUSSELS.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Whatever certain authors may have said on the subject, it is
possible to discover in a suspected liquid all the alkaloids, in
whatever state they may be. I am quite convinced that every
Chemist who has kept up his knowledge as to analysis, will not
only succeed in detecting their presence, but even in determining
the nature of that which he has discovered, provided that
the alkaloid in question is one of that class of bodies, the properties
of which have been suitably studied. Thus he will be
able to discover conia, nicotine, aniline, picoline, petinine, morphine,
codeine, narcotine, strychnine, brucine, veratrine, colchicine,
delphine, emetine, solanine, aconitine, atropine, hyoscyamine.
I do not pretend to say that the chemical study of all
these alkaloids has been sufficiently well made to enable the experimenter
who detects one of them to know it immediately,
and affirm that it is such an alkaloid, and not such another.
Nevertheless, in those even which he cannot positively determine
or specify, he may be able to say that it belongs to such
a family of vegetables—the Solanaceæ, for example. In a case
of poisoning by such agents, even this will be of much importance.
The method which I now propose for detecting the alkaloids
in suspected matters, is nearly the same as that employed
for extracting those bodies from the vegetables which contain
them. The only difference consists in the manner of setting
them free, and of presenting them to the action of solvents.
We know that the alkaloids form acid salts, which are equally
soluble in water and alcohol; we know also that a solution of
these acid salts can be decomposed so that the base set at liberty
remains either momentarily or permanently in solution
in the liquid. <i>I have observed that all the solid and fixed alkaloids
above enumerated, when maintained in
a free state</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
<i>and in solution in a liquid, can be taken up by ether when
this solvent is in sufficient quantity.</i> Thus, to extract an alkaloid
from a suspected substance, the only problem to resolve
consists in separating, by the aid of simple means, the foreign
matters, and then to find a base which, in rendering the alkaloid
free, retains it in solution, in order that the ether may extract
it from the liquid. Successive treatment by water and
alcohol of different degrees of concentration, suffices for separating
the foreign matters, and obtaining in a small bulk a solution
in which the alkaloid can be found. The bicarbonates
of potash or soda, or these alkalies in a caustic state, are convenient
bases for setting the alkaloids at liberty, at the same
time keeping them wholly in solution, especially if the alkaloids
have been combined with an excess of tartaric or of
oxalic acid.</p>

<p>To separate foreign substances, animal or otherwise, from the
suspected matters, recourse is commonly had to the tribasic acetate
of lead, and precipitating the lead afterwards by a current
of sulphuretted hydrogen. As I have several times witnessed,
this procedure has many and very serious inconveniences. In
the first place, the tribasic acetate of lead, even when used in
large excess, comes far short of precipitating all the foreign
matters; secondly, the sulphuretted hydrogen, which is used to
precipitate the lead, remains in combination with certain organic
matters which undergo great changes by the action of the
air and of even a moderate heat; so that animal liquids which
have been precipitated by the tribasic acetate of lead, and from
which the lead has been separated afterwards by hydrosulphuric
acid, color rapidly on exposure to the air, and exhale at the
same time a putrid odor, which adheres firmly to the matters
which we extract afterwards from these liquids. The use of a
salt of lead presents another inconvenience, viz.: the introduction
of foreign metals into the suspected matters, so that
that portion of the suspected substance is rendered unfit for
testing for mineral substances. The successive and combined
use of water and alcohol at different
states of concentration, <span class="xxpn" id="p345">{345}</span>
permits us to search for mineral substances, whatever be their
nature, so that in this way nothing is compromised, which is of
immense advantage when the analyst does not know what poison
he is to look for.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say, that in medico-legal researches
for the alkaloids, we ought never to use animal charcoal for decolorizing
the liquids, because we may lose all the alkaloid in
the suspected matters. It is generally known that animal charcoal
absorbs these substances at the same time that it fixes the
coloring and odoriferous matters.</p>

<p>[This is no doubt true; we must not use animal charcoal to
decolorize, and then look for the alkaloid in the <i>liquid</i>, but we
may use it, at least in the case of strychnia and some of the
non-volatile alkaloids, to separate them, and then we look for
them <i>in the charcoal</i>. See notice of Graham and Hofmann’s
Process for Detecting Strychnia: <i>Monthly Journal</i>, Aug., 1852,
p. 140; <i>Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Journal</i>, vol. xi., p. 504, May, 1852.]</p>

<p>The above observations do not proceed from speculative ideas
only, but are the result of a pretty long series of experiments
which I have several times employed for discovering these organic
alkaloids. To put in practice the principles which I have
thus explained, the following is the method in which I propose
to set about such an analysis:—I suppose that we wish to look
for an alkaloid in the contents of the stomach or intestines; we
commence by adding to these matters twice their weight of
pure and very strong alcohol;<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn26" id="fnanch26">26</a>
we add afterwards, according
to the quantity and nature of the suspected matter, from ten to
thirty grains of tartaric or oxalic acid—in preference tartaric;
we introduce the mixture into a flask, and heat it to 160° or
170° Fahrenheit. After it has completely cooled it is to be filtered,
the insoluble residue washed with strong
alcohol, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span>
filtered liquid evaporated in vacuo. If the operator has not an
air-pump, the liquid is to be exposed to a strong current of air at a
temperature of not more than 90° Fahrenheit. If, after the volatilization
of the alcohol, the residue contains fatty or other
insoluble matters, the liquid is to be filtered a second time, and
then the filtrate and washings of the filter evaporated in the
air-pump till nearly dry. If we have no air pump, it is to be
placed under a bell-jar over a vessel containing concentrated
sulphuric acid. We are then to treat the residue with cold
anhydrous alcohol, taking care to exhaust the substance thoroughly;
we evaporate the alcohol in the open air at the ordinary
temperature, or still better, in vacuo; we now dissolve
the acid residue in the smallest possible quantity of water, and
introduce the solution into a small test-tube, and add little by
little pure powdered bicarbonate of soda or potash, till a fresh
quantity produces no further effervescence of carbonic acid.
We then agitate the whole with four or five times its bulk of
pure ether, and leave it to settle. When the ether swimming
on the top is perfectly clear, then decant some of it into a capsule,
and leave it in <i>a very dry place</i> to spontaneous evaporation.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch26" id="fn26">26</a>
When we wish to look for an alkaloid in the tissue of an
organ, as the liver, heart, or lungs, we must first divide the organ
into very small fragments, moisten the mass with pure strong alcohol,
then express strongly, and by further treatment with alcohol exhaust
the tissue of everything soluble. The liquid so obtained, is to be
treated in the same way as a mixture of suspected matter and alcohol.</p></div>

<p>Now, two orders of things may present themselves; either
the alkaloid contained in the suspected matter is liquid and volatile,
or solid and fixed. I shall now consider these two
hypotheses.</p>

<h4>EXAMINATION FOR A LIQUID AND VOLATILE ALKALI.</h4>

<p>We suppose there exists a liquid and volatile alkaloid. In
such a case, by the evaporation of the ether, there remains in
the inside of the capsule some small liquid striæ which fall to
the bottom of the vessel. In this case, under the influence of
the heat of the hand, the contents of the capsule exhale an
odor more or less disagreeable, which becomes, according to
the nature of the alkaloid, more or less pungent, suffocating,
irritant; it presents, in short, a smell like that of a volatile alkali
masked by an animal odor. If we discover any traces of
the presence of a volatile alkaloid, we add then
to the contents <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
of the vessel, from which we have decanted a small quantity
of ether, one or two fluid drachms of a strong solution of caustic
potash or soda, and agitate the mixture. After a sufficient
time, we draw off the ether into a test-tube; we exhaust the
mixture by two or three treatments with ether, and unite all
the ethereal fluids. We pour afterwards into this ether, holding
the alkaloid in solution, one or two drachms of water, acidulated
with a fifth part of its weight of pure sulphuric acid,
agitate it for some time, leave it to settle, pour off the ether
swimming on the top, and wash the acid liquid at the bottom
with a new quantity of ether. As the sulphates of ammonia,
of nicotine, aniline, quinoleine, picoline, and petinine, are entirely
insoluble in ether, the water acidulated with sulphuric
acid contains the alkaloid in a small bulk, and in the state of a
pure sulphate; but as the sulphate of conia is soluble in ether,
the ether may contain a small quantity of this alkali, but the
greater part remains in the acidulated watery solution. The
ether, on the other hand, retains all the animal matters which
it has taken from the alkaline solutions. If it on spontaneous
evaporation leaves a small quantity of a feebly-colored yellowish
residue, of a repulsive animal odor, mixed with a certain
quantity of sulphate of conine, this alkaloid exists in the suspected
matter under analysis. To extract the alkaloid from the
solution of the acid sulphate, we add to the latter an aqueous
and concentrated solution of potash or caustic soda, we agitate
and exhaust the mixture with pure ether; the ether dissolves
ammonia, and the alkaloid is now free. We expose the ethereal
solution at the lowest possible temperature to spontaneous
evaporation; almost all the ammonia volatilizes with the ether,
whilst the alkaloid remains as residue. To eliminate the last
traces of ammonia, we place for a few minutes the vessel containing
the alkaloid in a vacuum over sulphuric acid, and obtain
the organic alkaloid with the chemical and physical characters
which belong to it, and which it is now the Chemist’s
duty to determine positively.</p>

<p>I applied, on the 3d March, 1851, the process
which I have <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
described, to the detection of nicotine in the blood from the
heart of a dog poisoned by two cubic centimetres [0.78 C.I.] of
nicotine introduced into the œsophagus, and I was able in a
most positive manner to determine the presence of nicotine in
the blood. I was able to determine its physical characters, its
odor, taste, and alkalinity. I succeeded in obtaining the chloroplatinate
of the base perfectly crystallized in quadrilateral rhomboidal
prisms of a rather dark yellow color, and to ascertain
their insolubility in alcohol and ether.</p>

<p>I have applied the same process for the detection of conia in
a very old tincture of hemlock, which my friend and colleague
M. de Hemptinne was so kind as to put at my disposal; and I
was equally successful in extracting from the liquid colorless
conia, presenting all the physical and chemical properties of
this alkali. I was also able to prove that the ether which holds
conia in solution, carries off a notable portion of this alkaloid
when the solvent is exposed to spontaneous evaporation.</p>

<h4>EXAMINATION FOR A SOLID AND FIXED ALKALOID.</h4>

<p>Let us now suppose that the alkali is solid and fixed; in
that case, according to the nature of the alkali, it may happen
that the evaporation of the ether resulting from the treatment
of the acid matter, to which we have added bicarbonate of
soda, may leave or not a residue, containing an alkaloid. If it
does, we add a solution of caustic potash or soda to the liquid,
and agitate it briskly with ether. This dissolves the vegetable
alkaloid, now free and remaining in the solution of potash or
soda. In either case, we exhaust the matter with ether. Whatever
be the agent which has set the alkaloid free, whether it be
the bicarbonate of soda or potash, or caustic soda or potash, it
remains, by the evaporation of the ether, on the side of the
capsule as a solid body, but more commonly a colorless milky
liquid, holding solid matters in suspension. The odor of the
substance is animal, disagreeable, but not pungent. It turns
litmus paper permanently blue.</p>

<p>When we thus discover a solid alkaloid, the first thing to do
is to try and obtain it in a crystalline state, so as to
be able to <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span>
determine its form. Put some drops of alcohol in the capsule
which contains the alkaloid, and leave the solution to spontaneous
evaporation. It is, however, very rare that the alkaloid
obtained by the above process is pure enough to crystallize.
Almost always it is soiled by foreign matters. To isolate these
substances, some drops of water, feebly acidulated with sulphuric
acid, are poured into the capsule, and then moved over its
surface, so as to bring it in contact with the matter in the capsule.
Generally we observe that the acid water does not moisten
the sides of the vessel. The matter which is contained in it
separates into two parts, one formed of greasy matter, which
remains adherent to the sides—the other alkaline, which dissolves
and forms an acid sulphate. We cautiously decant the
acid liquid, which ought to be limpid and colorless, if the process
has been well executed; the capsule is well washed with
some drops of acidulated water, added to the first liquid, and
the whole is evaporated to three-fourths in vacuo, or under a
bell-jar over sulphuric acid. We put into the residue a very
concentrated solution of pure carbonate of potash, and treat
the whole liquid with absolute alcohol. This dissolves the alkaloid,
while it leaves untouched the sulphate of potash and
excess of carbonate of potash. The evaporation of the alcoholic
solution gives us the alkaloid in crystals.</p>

<p>It is now the Chemist’s business to determine its properties,
to be able to prove its individuality. I have applied the principles
which I have just expounded to the detection of morphine,
iodine, strychnine, brucine, veratrine, emetine, colchicine, aconitine,
atropine, hyoscyamine—and I have succeeded in isolating,
without the least difficulty, these different alkalies, previously
mixed with foreign matters.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>I have thus been able to extract, by this process, morphine
from opium, strychnine and brucine from nux vomica, veratrine
from extract of veratram, emetine from extract of ipecacuanha,
colchicine from tincture of colchicum, aconitine from an aqueous
extract of aconite, hyoscyamine from a very old extract of
henbane, and atropine from an equally old
tincture of <span class="xxpn" id="p350">{350}</span>
belladonna. Thus it is in all confidence that I submit this process
to the consideration of Chemists who undertake medico-legal
researches.—<i>Bulletin de l’ Académie Royale de Médecine de

has long been known that the itch is caused by the attack of a minute
insect, the acarus scabiei, the male of which has only been lately
detected, by the microscope. The ordinary sulphur ointment, though
successful after repeated applications, in destroying the insect, often
causes a good deal of irritation of the skin, and leaves the patient
with an eruption as troublesome if not as permanent as the itch itself.
M. Bourguignon, a French physician, finds that the infusion of the
seeds of the stavesacre, (Delphinium Staphisagria) or a solution of the
extract, not only speedily kills the insects and destroys their eggs,
but that it has no irritating influence whatever upon the skin itself.
He afterwards adopted an ointment, prepared by digesting over a vapor
bath, for twenty-four hours, three parts of stavesacre seeds in five
parts of lard, and straining the product while still liquid. He found
that friction with this ointment cured the patient in four days, while
seven days were required when sulphur ointment was used.</div>

<span class="smcap">P<b>OISONOUS</b></span> <span
class="smcap">H<b>ONEY.</b></span></h4>—The family of one of our most
respectable wholesale druggists has lately suffered severely from
symptoms of poisoning, caused by some honey which they had eaten.
The family of one of his neighbors likewise, to whom, induced by its
particularly fine appearance, he had sent some of the honey, were
affected in a similar manner. The number of those who partook of the
suspected article, all of whom were affected, though not to the same
degree, renders it certain that the symptoms were not caused by any
idiosyncracy, but were produced by some poisonous principle, probably
derived from some narcotico-acrid plant on which the bees had
fed.</div>

<p>On eating it there was an unpleasant sense of pricking and burning
in the throat, nausea, and a burning sensation throughout the whole
system, together with an immediate effect upon vision, approaching to
blindness. Several of those who <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span>
ate of the honey vomited violently and were in great distress. One was rendered
entirely blind and insensible, and it was feared for some time might not recover.
In the other cases the effect passed off in some ten or twelve hours. In one case
a single drop of the honey, taken on the end of the finger from the box where it
had leaked through a crevice, had such an effect on the sight that the person
could not see to read a newspaper, but it passed off within an hour.</p>

<p>“We are not aware,” continues our informant, “of any poisonous plants in the
vicinity where the honey was made, except what is called kill-calf, (Andromeda
Mariana) which is found in abundance on Hempstead Plains, at a distance
of about a mile.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>If, as is supposed, the poison was derived from some plant in which the bees
had fed, it must have been elaborated or concentrated in the economy of the insect,
or been the product of some reaction of the honey itself upon the poisonous
principle, since no poisonous vegetable is known which would produce such effects,
in such minute quantity.</p>

of a varitey of substances which have not previously been used in
medicine. He finds that the alkaloid furfurine in poisonous doses,
produces upon animals many of the symptoms of poisoning by quinine,

not an anti-periodic. He has likewise used nickel, generally in the
form of sulphate, and finds that it is exceedingly analagous in its

<h3>ON THE PRESERVATION OF IODIDE OF IRON.
<span class="hsmall">
BY HENRY WURTZ.</span></h3>

<p>There can be no doubt that imperfections exist in many of
the methods at present in use for the preservation of various
articles of the materia medica. Wherever the fault may be in
these cases, the evil is generally shared between the physicians
and the patients, much the larger share of course, falling to the
latter. The <i>iodide of iron</i> is one of these articles, and it will
appear probable from the sequel that, in a multitude of cases,
this remedy is administered to the patient in quantities which
are inconstant and much too small to produce the effect contemplated
by the physician in his prescription.</p>

<p>One method, extensively employed, of preserving iodide of
iron, for use in medicine, is in the form of an aqueous solution
in which a coil of iron wire is kept immersed. This method is
given by Pereira,<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn27" id="fnanch27">27</a>
as proposed by Hemingway. Pereira also
remarks in another place that “it is important to know, that
by keeping a coil of iron wire in a solution of the protiodide,
as suggested by Mr. Squire, no free iodine or sesquiodide of
iron is formed although the liquid may be fully exposed to air
and light; sesquioxide of iron is formed, but if the solution be
filtered it is found to contain protiodide only.”</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch27" id="fn27">27</a>
Materia Medica, 3rd Am. Ed. 1, 745.</p></div>

<p>In a paper previously published in this journal, I have remarked
with reference to this matter, that
I should strongly <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span>
suspect in this case a formation of a subiodide of iron and consequent
abstraction of iodine from the solution.<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanch28">28</a>
Since that
time I have been enabled to confirm this supposition by experiment.
Pieces of iron wire placed in contact with a colorless
solution of iodide of iron caused, in the course of a few
hours, the deposition of a precipitate, which had a dark orange
color quite distinct from the dark brown color of hydrated sesquioxide
of iron precipitated from a solution of the protochloride
of iron by metallic iron. This precipitate, being washed
with distilled water until the washings gave no indication of
the presence of <i>iron</i>, was still found to contain much iodine.
No quantitative analysis of the precipitate, however, was attempted,
for it was found that the washings which no longer
contained a trace of iron still gave with nitric acid and starch,
a strong iodine reaction, thus indicating that the subiodide of
iron upon the filter, whatever its composition, was decomposed
by the action of water and oxygen as soon as the neutral iodide
of iron was washed out. This is probably the reason why
previous observers have mistaken this precipitate for pure sesquioxide
of iron, having continued washing the precipitate
until the washing no longer gave an <i>iodine</i> reaction, instead of
an <i>iron</i> reaction as in the plan adopted by me, and consequently
until all the subiodide of iron was decomposed and nothing but
sesquioxide of iron was actually left upon the filter.</p>

<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch28" id="fn28">28</a>
New-York Journal of Pharmacy, August, 1852.</p></div>

<p>The washings, however, after the removal of the iodide
of iron, gave no iodine reaction with starch until after the
addition of nitric acid; iodine, therefore, could only have
been present in the form of hydriodic acid and the reaction
by which the unknown subiodide of iron was decomposed
may be represented as
follows:—2&#x202f;Fe&#x202f;I<span class="spfract"><span class="spfup">1</span><span class="spfdn">x</span></span>&#x202f;+
<span class="spfract"><span class="spfup">1</span><span class="spfdn">x</span></span>H&#x202f;O&#x202f;+
(3−<span class="spfract"><span
class="spfup">1</span><span class="spfdn">x</span></span>)O&#x202f;= Fe&#x202f;<sup>2</sup>O<sup>3</sup> +
<span class="spfract"><span class="spfup">1</span><span
class="spfdn">x</span></span>HI.</p>

<p>Since the above experiments were made, I have found that
I have, after all, merely been in a measure confirming an observation
of the illustrious Ber­zelius. <i>Gmelin’s Handbuch</i>
under the head of <i>Ein­fach­io­dei­sen</i>, has the following, “Nach
Ber­zel­ius ist das braune Pulver welches sich
beim Aussetzen des <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span>
wäss­rigen Ein­fach­io­dei­sens an die Luft absetzt, nicht reines
Eisenoxyd, sondern ein basisches salz.”<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanch29">29</a></p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the method of preserving iodide
of iron in solution, in contact with metallic iron is perfectly
fallacious. This remedy, if preserved in solution at all, should
be kept in bottles hermetically closed.</p>
<div class="dkeeptogether">
<div class="dftnt">

<p class="pfirst">
<a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanch29" id="fn29">29</a>
According to Berzelius, the brown powder, which is
deposited upon exposure of aqueous protiodide of iron to the air, is
not pure sesquioxide of iron, but a basic salt.</p></div>

 <h3>OBSERVATIONS ON THE VOL­A­TIL­I­TY AND SOL­U­BIL­I­TY
 OF CAN­THAR­DIN IN VIEW OF THE MOST EL­E­GI­BLE
 PHAR­MA­CEU­TI­CAL TREAT­MENT OF SPA­NISH FLIES. <span
 class="hsmall"> BY WILLIAM PROCTER, JR.</span></h3>
 </div><!--section-->

<p>Cantharides have been used in Pharmacy since the days of
Hippocrates. It was not till 1810, however, that the principle
giving them activity was isolated by Robiquet (Annal. de
Chimie lxxvi. 302,) and subsequently named <i>Cantharidin</i> by
Dr. Thomas Thompson. Since then various experimenters
have been engaged in the chemical investigation of these flies,
and in the more recent treatises they are stated to consist of
<i>cantharidin</i>, <i>yellow fixed oil</i>, <i>green fixed oil</i>, <i>a yellow viscous
substance</i>, <i>a black matter</i>, <i>ozmazome</i>, <i>uric acid</i>, <i>acetic acid</i>,
<i>phosphoric acid</i>, and the <i>phosphate of lime and magnesia</i>.
It is proverbial among apothecaries and physicians, that the
phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal preparations designed to produce vesication,
vary very much in their power as prepared by different individuals,
and from different samples of cantharides by the same
recipes. Is this variableness of power due to the inequality of
strength of the commercial drug? or, are we to attribute it to
the treatment employed by the apothecary? The real importance
of these queries demands an
answer. To proceed <span class="xxpn" id="p356">{356}</span>
properly, the investigator should examine cantharidin in a pure
state, ascertain how far the statements of writers are correct,
then by a series of analyses, quantitative as regards that principle,
determine whether its proportion varies, and to what extent,
in different specimens of cantharides of fair quality; and
finally to test the preparations derived from the same samples
and see how far they correspond with the inferences drawn
from the ascertained properties and proportion of the active
principle. I have at present undertaken to resolve but a part
of these queries—yet by far the most important ones—as will
be seen.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth08">
<img src="images/i356.jpg" width="288" height="140"
alt="Cantharidin crystal forms" /></div>

<p>Cantharidin is a white, neutral substance, of which the formula
according to Regnault is C<sub>10</sub>&#x202f;H&#x202f;O<sub>4</sub>. Gmelin considers it
of the nature of a solid volatile oil. As usually seen it has the
form of minute flatted four-sided prisms (<i>c</i>,) much broken up,
so as to appear like scales. When deposited from an ethereal
solution of cantharides by slow evaporation, or from its solution
in hot acetic acid by cooling, it assumes the form of flattened
oblique four-sided prisms with dihedral summits, derived from
the rectangular prism by the bevelment
of its edges (see fig. <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
from <i>c</i>.) The crystals by slow sublimation
are four-sided rectangular
prisms of great brilliance and sometimes
iridescent, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>.<br class="brclearfix" /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>OLUBILITY.</b></span>—Pure
cantharidin is insoluble in water, hot or
cold. It is slightly soluble in cold alcohol, readily so when
hot. Ether dissolves it to a greater extent, yet much more
easily hot than cold. Chloroform is its best solvent, cold or
hot, as shown in a former essay (Am. Jour. Pharm. vol. xxiii.
124,) and will remove it from the aqueous infusion of the flies.
Acetic ether dissolves cantharidin, especially when hot, but
does not retain much on cooling. When one part of cantharides
is mixed with 20 parts of olive oil and heated to 250° Fahr.
it is completely dissolved. As the solution cools, the cantharidin
rapidly separates in shining needles in
such quantity as <span class="xxpn" id="p357">{357}</span>
at first to give the oil a pulpy consistence. The clear cold oil
retains sufficient to act as an efficient rubefacient but not as an
epispastic. One part of cantharidin requires 70 parts of oil
of turpentine to dissolve it at the boiling temperature, the
greater part separating, as the solution cools, in long asbestos-like
needles. A piece of paper saturated with the cold solution
and applied to the skin under adhesive plaster did not
vesicate. Acetone (from the distillation of acetate of lime) dissolves
cantharidin with great readiness and ranks next to chloroform
in this regard. The solution deposits the substance in
crystals by evaporation. The commercial methylic alcohol or
wood naphtha also dissolves cantharidin, but to a much less
extent than acetone. When acetic acid
<span class="nowrap">sp. gr. 1.41</span>
<span class="nowrap">(U. S. P.,)</span>
is added to cantharidin, it but slightly acts on it in the cold;
heat much increases its solvent power, which is lost on cooling
and the substance deposited by standing, though not immediately.
One part of cantharidin was mixed with 40 parts of <i>crystallizable</i>
acetic acid and agitated together during five hours, but a
small percentage was dissolved; but on applying heat the
crystals were dissolved quickly. On standing, nearly all of
the cantharidin was slowly deposited in regular crystals. To
ascertain whether, as has been asserted,<a class="aftntanc" href="#fn30" id="fnanch30">30</a>
a combination was
effected, and an <i>acetate</i> of cantharidin produced, an acetic solution
of cantharidin was evaporated to dryness and the crystals
mixed with strong sulphuric acid and heated till dissolved,
while the nose was held near, without the slightest evidence of
acetic odor; one twentieth of a grain of acetate of potassa was
then added, which instantly evolved the well marked smell of
acetic acid. Formic acid dissolves but a trace of cantharidin,
cold or hot; and muriatic acid sp. gr. 1.18 hardly can be said
to act on it in the cold, but when boiling a minute portion is
taken up. The same is true of phosphoric acid dissolved in
five parts water. Sulphuric acid sp. gr. 1.840, when heated
readily dissolves pure cantharidin
without being discolored, <span class="xxpn" id="p358">{358}</span>
and deposits it in crystals unchanged by cooling. Hot nitric
acid sp. gr. 1.38, dissolves cantharidin readily, and deposits the
greater part of it on cooling in brilliant crystals, unchanged.
A concentrated solution of ammonia slowly dissolves cantharidin
to a small extent, and yields it up on evaporation in
crystals. Solutions of pottassa and of soda also dissolve this
principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I<b>TS</b></span>
<span class="smcap">V<b>OLATILITY.</b></span>—About ten grains of pure and perfectly dry
cantharidin was spread on the pan of an Oertling’s balance,
(sensitive to 1-150th of a grain,) and the equilibrium carefully
adjusted with platina weights. After exposure for a week to
the action of the air, a vessel of lime being present to keep the
air dry, no change in the adjustment had occurred. To further
test the volatility of cantharidin, a portion of it was put at
the bottom of a dry test tube, through a paper funnel so as not
to soil the sides, which was then fixed so as to dip half an inch
in a mercurial bath having a thermometer suspended in it.
It lost nothing appreciable after being kept at 212° F. for half
an hour, no sublimate being visible with a lens. At 220° F.
no visible effect was produced. Kept at 250° F. for twenty
minutes, a very slow sublimation commenced. At 300° F. the
vaporization was but slightly increased. The heat was then
raised to 360° F., when the sublimation became more decided,
yet still slow. Between 402° F. and 410° F. it fused, and
rapidly sublimed at a few degrees higher. Cantharidin at this
temperature volatilizes with great ease and condenses in beautiful
well defined crystals like salicylic acid.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of cantharidin is considerable, as it sinks
in nitric acid sp. gr. 1.38; it is exceedingly acrid; its powder
applied to the skin with a little oil, produces speedy vesication,
and taken internally it is an irritant poison of the most virulent
kind.</p>

<p>Such are some of the more prominent characters of this remarkable
substance, which exhibits a permanence and want of
affinity extraordinary in an animal principle. Let us now see
how far experiments with cantharidin as it exists in the flies in
substance, correspond with its behaviour in
an isolated state. <span class="xxpn" id="p359">{359}</span></p>

<p>1st. Is cantharidin, as it exists in Spanish flies, volatile at
common temperatures, or at the temperature usually employed
in making the cerate; and if so to what extent?</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Six hundred grains of powdered cantharides were put into
a quart flask, a pint of water poured on, and macerated two
hours. The flask was then adapted to a glass tubulated receiver
by means of a long glass tube, the joints made tight,
and the tube refrigerated throughout its length by a current of
cool water, the receiver itself being surrounded by water. A
sand-bath heat was then applied and the materials in the flask
kept boiling during several hours, until half a pint liquid had
distilled. The product in the receiver was opalescent, with
white particles floating through it, and had a strong odor of
spanish flies. It was decanted into a bottle, and agitated repeatedly
with half an ounce of chloroform, which dissolved the
particles and removed the opalescence. The chloroform, when
separated with a funnel, and evaporated spontaneously, yielded
a colorless semi-crystalline residue, having a waxy consistence
and a strong odor different from that of the flies. It
fused at 120° Fahr., was volatile <i>per se</i>, but was partially decomposed
and condensed in drops which subsequently solidified.
This substance is soluble in alcohol, ether and chloroform,
is decomposed and dissolved by sulphuric acid, produces <i>no
signs of vesication after forty-eight hours’ contact with the
skin</i> under adhesive plaster, and is most probably the same
volatile principle that has been noticed by Orfila.</p>

<p>The long glass tube was then examined for a sublimate, by
rinsing it thoroughly with chloroform, which, on evaporation,
afforded more of the same substance obtained from the distilled
water, and like it did not produce vesication.</p>

<p>This experiment shows conclusively that cantharidin <i>does not
volatilize to an appreciable extent with water evaporating
from cantharides</i>.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> More water was added to the residue in the flask, again
boiled for fifteen minutes and thrown on a displacing filter,
and water added to the solid residue, after
the decoction had <span class="xxpn" id="p360">{360}</span>
ceased to pass, until the absorbed liquid was displaced. The
decoction was much less odorous than the distilled water, and
had a deep reddish-brown color. Half of this was agitated repeatedly
with chloroform. The latter decanted and evaporated
yielded a crop of crystals intermixed with some coloring matter.
A part of these heated in a tube over a lamp, gave immediately
the brilliant crystaline sublimate of cantharidin well
marked; another portion applied to the skin produced vesication
in a few hours.</p>

<p>The other half of the decoction was evaporated to a soft extract
by direct heat. This produced speedy and deep vesication,
more effectual than that of pure cantharidin, as in the extract
that principle was in a soluble state by virtue of the yellow
matter of the flies.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The residual flies were then dried carefully and exhausted
with ether, which assumed a deep green color. A green semi-fluid
fatty oil was obtained by evaporation, from which a fluid
yellow oil separated by standing, which produced a tardy vesication,
not comparable with the aqueous extract.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> One hundred grains of flies in powder were introduced
into a test tube so as not to soil the sides. This was then kept
at the temperature of 212° F. during six hours, by causing
it to dip into a vessel of boiling water through a tin plate.
The hygrometric water was removed as it condensed above.
At the end of the experiment a minute deposit of microscopic
crystals less than one thirtieth of a grain, was observed above
the flies on the side of the tube.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Two hundred grains of flies were introduced into a two
ounce retort, which they half filled, adapted to a two ounce
receiver, and this again connected with a third vessel. The
retort heated by a mercurial bath, was kept at 225° F., for two
hours, without any product except a little odorous hygrometric
water. The heat was then raised to 412° F., when a colorless
oily matter flowed slowly into the receiver, mixed with
water, whilst a crystalline matter mixed with oil collected in
the neck. This crystalline matter mixed with
the oil produced <span class="xxpn" id="p361">{361}</span>
vesication when applied to the skin. The heat was now rapidly
increased so as to produce brown vapors, from which was
condensed a dark colored empyreumatic oil, abundant crystals
of an ammonical salt collected in the tubes and on the sides of
the receiver, whilst the aqueous liquor in the receiver was
strongly ammonical. Neither the dark oil nor the crystals produced
vesication, the high temperature having probably decomposed
the cantharidin.</p>

<p>From these experiments it must be admitted that cantharidin
is less volatile than has been asserted. The effect produced
on the eye of the pupil of Robiquet who was watching
the cry­stal­li­za­tion of cantharidin during the evaporation of an
ethereal solution, may be accounted for by the mechanical action
of the dense ethereal vapor escaping near his eye, as he
watched the process with a lens, carrying off some particles of
cantharidin; and the readiness with which this principle may
be brought mechanically in contact with the skin of the face,
during a series of experiments, by want of care, will easily account
for the occasional testimony of writers in favor of its
volatility at low temperatures based on that kind of evidence.
During the whole of the experiments detailed in this paper,
the author has not experienced any inconvenience to his eyes
or face except in two instances, once when decomposing cantharides
by destructive distillation, during which some of the
vapors escaped near his person, and again where a small capsule
containing aqueous extract of cantharides was accidentally
exposed to high temperature over a lamp so as to partially decompose
it; he suffered slight pain for a few hours in the conjunctiva
of both eyes.</p>

<p>It must also be admitted that the heat ordinarily employed
in making the blistering cerate of the United States Pharmacopœia,
does not injure the preparation by volatilizing the cantharidin,
and that the recommendation to digest the flies in the
melted vehicle on a water bath is not only not injurious, but
decidedly advantageous, as it increases, many fold, the solvent
power of
the fatty matter. <span class="xxpn" id="p362">{362}</span></p>

<p>2d. Having ascertained the solvent powers of olive oil, oil
of turpentine and acetic acid, on pure cantharidin, the following
experiments were made with those menstrua, and with water,
on the flies in substance:</p>

<p><i>a.</i> One hundred grains of powdered cantharides were mixed
with two hundred grains of olive oil in a large test tube,
which was corked, and the mixture heated in a boiling
water bath during four hours, with occasional agitation. The
contents of the tube were then poured into a small glass displacement
apparatus, surrounded with water kept hot by a
lamp, and the saturated oil gradually displaced, without cooling,
by the addition of fresh portions of oil. The oily liquid
thus obtained had a deep green color, smelled strongly of the
flies, and when applied to the skin produced full vesication
in about twelve hours contact. After standing twenty-four
hours shining needles of cantharidin gradually separated, but
not in quantity.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> One hundred grains of powdered flies were mixed with
two hundred grains of pure oil of turpentine in a closed tube,
heated in a boiling water bath four hours, and displaced while
hot as in the preceding experiment. The terebinthinate solution
had a dull yellow color, and was perfectly transparent as
it passed, but in a short time numerous minute stellated crystals
commenced forming, which increased in quantity by standing.
The saturated cold solution, separated from the crystals
after standing twenty-four hours, did not blister when applied
to the skin.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> One hundred grains of powdered flies were digested in a
close vessel, at the temperature of boiling water, in three hundred
grains of acetic acid sp. gr. 1.041, for six hours, and then
subjected to displacement in the hot filter above noticed. A
dark reddish-brown transparent liquid passed, which had very
little odor of flies, even when a portion was exposed until the
acetic acid had nearly all evaporated. A portion of this liquid
applied to the skin produced complete vesication in about ten
hours. After standing a few hours,
numerous minute <span class="xxpn" id="p363">{363}</span>
granular crystals were deposited, which gradually increased in
amount and size.</p>

<p>These three experiments prove that hot fatty matter is a
good solvent for cantharidin as it exists in the flies, and that
it retains more on cooling than either turpentine or acetic
acid. That hot oil of turpentine is a good solvent for extracting
cantharidin, although it does not retain much on cooling,
and that officinal acetic acid at the temperature of 212° F. will
remove cantharidin readily from Spanish flies, but retains but
a part on cooling.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Five hundred grains of recently powdered flies, contained
in a flask, were boiled in a pint of water, for an hour, and
the clear decoction decanted, the residue again treated with
half a pint of water, so as to remove all matter soluble in that
liquid. The decoctions were mixed, filtered, and evaporated
carefully to dryness. The extract was exhausted by repeated
treatment with boiling alcohol, which left a dark colored pulpy
matter, very soluble in water, from which it is precipitated
by subacetate of lead. The alcoholic solution was now evaporated
to a syrup, and on cooling yielded a yellow extract like
mass, interspersed with numerous minute four-sided prisms.
By washing a portion with water, the yellow matter was removed,
leaving the crystals white and pure. The aqueous
washings yielded by evaporation a residue of crystals, and
does not vesicate. When the alcoholic extract was treated
with chloroform the crystals were dissolved, and the yellow
matter left. On evaporating the chloroform solution the crystals
were re-obtained with all the characters of cantharidin. The
matter left by chloroform was now treated with water, in
which it dissolved, except a trace of dark substance, and was
again evaporated carefully. It afforded a yellow honey-like
residue, thickly interspersed with crystals and strongly acid to
litmus, without vesicating power.</p>

<p>A portion of the yellow matter separated from the alcoholic extract
by water was boiled with some cantharidin, filtered and
evaporated. The residue treated with
chloroform afforded no <span class="xxpn" id="p364">{364}</span>
cantharidin; hence it would appear that although the yellow
matter enables the cantharidin to dissolve in water and cold
alcohol, when once separated its solvent power ceases.</p>

<p>Having now studied the effects of the ordinary solvents on
cantharidin in a free state, and in the condition in which it
exists in the insect, we are prepared to consider with some
clearness, the phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal preparations of the Spanish fly,
and their action as vesicants.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> If 1-30th of a grain of pure cantharidin, in fine powder,
be placed on the skin of the arm and covered with a piece of
warmed adhesive plaster, active vesication occurs in eight hours,
with pain. If the same quantity of cantharidin be put on the
other arm, a small piece of paper be laid over it, and then a
piece of adhesive plaster with a circular hole in it be applied,
so as to hold on the paper, no vesication occurs in sixteen
hours, the powder remaining dry. If then a large piece of
plaster be put over the whole, at the end of eight hours more
no blistering action will have taken place. If now a trace of
olive oil be applied to the back of the paper covering the cantharidin,
and the plaster replaced, speedy vesication will occur.
These experiments prove that cantharidin must be in solution
to have its vesicating action, and that oily matter is a proper
medium.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> When powdered flies are stirred into the ordinary vehicle
of resin, wax, and lard, so as to chill it almost immediately
as was formerly directed, but little of the cantharidin is dissolved
by the fatty matter, and when applied to the skin the
process of vesication is retarded. If, however, the cerate be
kept fluid for a length of time, say for half an hour, by a
water-bath or other regular heat, no loss of cantharidin occurs
by the heat, the active principle is in a great measure dissolved
by the fat, and every part is impregnated and active. In the
foregoing experiments it has been shown that twenty parts of
olive oil will dissolve one of cantharidin when hot. If we admit
with Thierry that cantharides contain but four thousandths
of their weight of cantharidin, the quantity
contained in a <span class="xxpn" id="p365">{365}</span>
pound of cerate is about <i>eight</i> grains, whilst the lard in the
same weight of cerate is 1600 grains, or two hundred times
the weight of that principle, not to speak of the influence of
the wax and resin, which, in union, with the melted lard, act
as solvents. Hence the whole of the cantharidin may be dissolved
by the vehicle. Another advantage of employing a
continued heat in digestion is the removal of the hygrometric
water from the flies, which is the source of the mouldiness to
which the cerate is prone in certain conditions.</p>

<p>In a former essay (Amer. Journ. Pharm., vol. xiii, p. 302,) I
have advocated digestion in making this cerate, (a recommendation
also made by Mr. Donovan, of Dublin, about the same
time,) and also the use of a portion of the oil of turpentine to
facilitate the solution of the cantharidin, but the foregoing experiments
prove that fatty matter is quite as good, if not a better
solvent alone than with turpentine.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> It has been asserted long ago by Beaupoil, Robiquet and
others, that water will perfectly extract the active matter from
Spanish flies, which these experiments corroborate. Hence it
is easy to understand how the condensed perspiration may facilitate
the action of a blister, especially when, as was formerly
much the case, its surface is coated with the dust of the flies,
and the skin moistened.</p>

<p>It is also clear why the Unguentum Cantharidis of the
United States Pharmacopœia is active although made with a
decoction of flies, yet, in this preparation, care should be observed
not to evaporate all the water, as on the existence of the
aqueous extract in a soft state depends much of the efficiency of
the preparation as an irritant dressing.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> In the Linimentum Cantharidis, United States Pharm.,
in which an ounce of flies is digested in eight fluid ounces of
oil of turpentine, the cantharidin is to be the menstruum as 1
to 1500, a proportion probably quite sufficient to retain it in
solution. The importance of the officinal direction to digest is
evident. It is quite doubtful whether this liniment, as made
by the process of Dr. Joseph Hartshorne, one part
of flies to <span class="xxpn" id="p366">{366}</span>
three parts of oil, will retain all the cantharidin after standing
awhile.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The Acetum Cantharidis, (Lond. Ph.) made by macerating
an ounce of flies in ten fluid ounces of acetic acid, 1.48, has
been criticised by Mr. Redwood, (Pharm. Journal, Oct. 1841,)
who arrived at the conclusion that it owed its vesicating power
almost solely to the acid, he not being able to discover cantharidin
in it. The inefficiency of <i>cold</i> acetic acid as a solvent
for <i>pure</i> cantharidin has been proven by the above experiments,
and its efficiency when hot equally shown. There can
be little doubt that the London preparation would be much
improved by <i>digesting</i> the flies in the acid for an hour in a
close glass vessel at the temperature of boiling water.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> The <i>cantharidal collodion</i> of M. Ilisch has been considerably
used as a vesicant in this country. Ether being a good
solvent for cantharidin readily keeps that principle in solution.
When applied to the skin, the escape of the ether leaves a
coating of ethereal extract of cantharides, admixed with collodion.
This preparation sometimes fails from a deficiency of
cantharidin, at other times from want of a sufficient body in
the collodion excipient, and it has been found more advantageous
to treat the cantharides with ether till exhausted, distill
off the ether, and add the oily residue to collodion of the proper
consistence. The addition of a little olive oil, and of Venice
turpentine, as recommended by Mr. Rand, will give more
activity to the preparation, especially if a piece of oiled silk or
adhesive plaster be applied over the part.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Besides these, many other epispastic preparations are
made in France and other countries. The acetic alcoholic extract
of cantharides of Ferrari is made by digesting four parts
of cantharides in sixteen parts of alcohol 36° B. mixed with
one part of acetic acid 10° B. In the opinion of the author,
the acetic acid tends to prevent the cry­stal­li­za­tion of the cantharidin,
a statement rendered doubtful by the above experiments,
as that principle separates in crystals from an acetic solution
of cantharides. The alcohol dissolves
the green oil <span class="xxpn" id="p367">{367}</span>
which gives to the extract a butyraceous consistence. This is
undoubtedly an efficient preparation, and is used by spreading
it on paper with a brush, and applying to the skin. Nearly
all the French preparations direct digestion of from 2 to 6
hours, showing evidently that the experience of phar­ma­ceu­tists
is opposed to the opinion that cantharides is “a very volatile
substance, even at common temperatures.”</p>

<p>The vesicating tafeta of the Codex, is that proposed by
Messrs. Henry &amp; Guibourt, and is made by fusing together
one part of the ethereal extract of cantharides and two of wax,
and spreading it on waxed paper or linen in the manner of adhesive
plaster. This preparation is said to lose its efficiency
by exposure to the air. How can this occur in view of the results
which have been detailed above? admitting the fact, it is
not probable that the change lies in the strong tendency of
the cantharidin to separate in crystals? a change easily observable
in the ethereal extract. This is the chief objection to
some otherwise excellent preparations of cantharides for vesication,
and it is far more probably the true explanation, than,
that volatility should be the cause.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The recently prepared and soft aqueous extract of cantharides
has been shown to be a powerful epispastic. Will this
extract of the consistence of honey, associated with sufficient
acetic acid, alcohol, or acetone, to preserve it, keep without
the gradual separation of the cantharidin? If so, it will undoubtedly
prove one of the very best blistering agents, as by
simply applying a covering of it over the surface of waxed
paper, or adhesive plaster, with a camel’s-hair brush, a perfect
blistering plaster can be made quickly and neatly, and all tendency
to change of aggregation by the action of the air on the
menstruum avoided. This is a question now under trial, and
should it result favorably, a formula will be published. The
extraordinary tendency of cantharidin to crystallize, even
under the most adverse circumstances, taken in connection
with its insolubility, <i>per se</i>, has hardly received sufficient attention
from phar­ma­ceu­tists as a cause of
the deterioration of <span class="xxpn" id="p368">{368}</span>
cantharidal preparations, and the discovery of a menstruum,
that will retain that principle in solution for an indefinite period,
is a problem yet to be solved, and worthy the attention of
phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal investigators.</p>

<h3>ON GELSEMINUM SEMPERVIRENS OR YELLOW
JASSAMIN.
<span class="hsmall">
BY WILLIAM PROCTER, JR.</span></h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Considerable attention has recently been turned to the Yellow
Jassamin of our Southern States, from the accidental discovery
of certain remarkable effects produced by it when taken
internally. A planter of Mississippi having suffered much
from a tedious attack of bilious fever, which resisted the usual
medicines employed in such cases, requested one of his servants
to obtain from the garden a certain root, from which he
intended to prepare an infusion for drinking. By mistake, the
person sent collected a different root, and administered the tea to
his master, who, soon after taking it, was seized with a complete
loss of muscular power, being, in fact, so completely prostrated
as to be unable to move a limb or to raise the eyelids, yet he
could hear, and could appreciate what was occurring around
him. After some hours, during which his friends were watching
him with much anxiety and little hope, he gradually recovered
his muscular control, and was astonished to find that
the fever had left him. Having ascertained from his servant
what plant he had collected, he subsequently employed it successfully
on his own plantation as well as among his neighbors.
The history becoming known to a quackish physician, he prepared
from it a nostrum called the
“Electrical Febrifuge,” in <span class="xxpn" id="p369">{369}</span>
which, it was disguised by oil of winter-green, (<i>Eclectic</i> Dispensatory,
page 186.)</p>

<p>The Gelseminum is not noticed by Dr. Griffith in his Medical
Botany, nor in the recent edition of the United States Dispensatory,
and so far appears to have been used chiefly by the
“Eclectic” practitioners of Cincinnati and other parts of the
Western States. The accompanying description of the plant
is taken partly from a specimen sent from Memphis, Tennessee,
where, in common with other parts of the south-western
States, it is cultivated as an ornamental garden plant.</p>

<p>The Gelseminum belongs to the natural order Apocyneæ, so
remarkable for the great activity of many of its genera, and
the name of the genus, given by Jussieu, is one of the ancient
names of the jessamine, and that of the species arises from its
evergreen foliage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">G<b>ELSEMINUM</b></span> belongs to Pentandria Digynia of Linnæus, and
to the natural order Apocyneæ of Jussieu.</p>

<p><i>Generic characters.</i>—Regular, calyx five parted, (the sepals
of this species being furnished with bract-like appendages)
carolla funnel-form, border spreading, five lobed, nearly equal,
capsule compressed, flat, two partible, two-celled, seeds flat
and attached to the margins of the valves, (Eaton.)</p>

<p><i>Specific characters.</i>—The G. sempervirens is known at the
South under the names yellow jasmine, wild jasmine, and
woodbine. In Florida it flowers in March, and in Mississippi
and Tennessee in May and June. Its stem is twining, smooth
and glabrous; its leaves are opposite, perennial, lanceolate,
entire, dark green above, paler beneath; with short petioles.
The flowers, which are esteemed poisonous, are yellow, about
an inch long and half an inch wide at the top, of a fine yellow
color, and have an agreeable odor, which perfumes the air
when they bloom. It grows luxuriantly, climbing from tree
to tree, forming a delightful shade. According to Eaton, from
whose botany we glean part of the above botanical notice, there
is a variety called inodorum which has scentless flowers.</p>

<p>The Gelseminum is indigenous to the Southern States, and
its beauty has caused its introduction
into the gardens. <span class="xxpn" id="p370">{370}</span></p>

<p><i>Medical properties and uses.</i>—The root is the part used, and
the tincture is the preparation most usually employed, and, as
made, must be a saturated tincture. The roots, in a green
state, well bruised, are introduced into a suitable vessel, and
covered with whiskey, or diluted alcohol. After standing two
weeks, the tincture is separated by expression and filtered. It
has a dark red color, and a pleasant bitter taste. The dose is
from ten to fifty drops. The following account of its medical
properties and effects is taken from a paper in the “Eclectic
Medical Journal,” August, 1852, page 353, by F. D. Hill of
Cincinnati:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Gelseminum is stimulant, tonic, and anti-spasmodic. By its relaxing effect
it produces gentle diaphoresis, and is said to be <i>narcotic</i>. Its effect in large
doses, or doses too frequently repeated, is extreme relaxation, and general prostration
of the whole muscular and nervous system. It will suspend and hold in
check muscular irritability and nervous excitement with more force and power
than any known remedy. It is of a pleasant bitter taste, and performs its wonder-working
cures, in all febrile diseases, without exciting either nausea, vomiting,
or purging. When enough has been given to produce its specific effect, the
eye is dimmed, the vision clouded and double, the head light and dizzy. When
these effects follow the ad­min­i­stra­tion of this remedy, no more should be given
until the patient has entirely recovered from its influence. ‘It maybe used
in all species of fevers, nervous and bilious headache, colds, pneumonia, hemorrhages,
leucorrhea, chorea, ague-cake, asthma, and many other diseases: but its
efficacy has been most admired in all forms and grades of fevers.’ It should
always be used with great care and caution. The root is said to possess a resinous
principle, which, when extracted by pure alcohol, will produce death in very
small doses. But no such effect need be expected from the proper dose of the
common tincture. There is danger of carrying it to such an extent as to suspend
involuntary muscular action, and when this is the case, death must ensue.
‘It is incompatible with no known substance, and may follow any <i>preceeding
treatment with perfect safety</i>.’ The dose is forty drops for an adult, and children
in proportion to age and temperament. It is given either with or without quinine.
It has been used alone for <i>chronic rheumatism</i>, in doses of forty drops,
three times a day, with marked effects. Three or four doses, with a mild cathartic,
will remove the redness and swelling attending inflamed sore eyes. Special
attention should be directed to the general health and constitution of the
patient before giving gelseminum. If the bowels be constipated they should be
moved by a gentle aperient, and kept in a relaxed condition. It requires double
the quantity to produce the effect on some that it does on others; and should the
practitioner ever produce too great a degree of relaxation, he should lose no
time in stimulating and toning
up his patient.” <span class="xxpn" id="p371">{371}</span></p></blockquote>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>The alleged effects of this plant on the human system, taken
in connection with its medico-botanical relations, mark it out
as being probably one of the most valuable of our indigenous
remedial agents, and render it well worthy of the investigation
of regular physicians.</p>

<p>Prussian blue, that has not undergone digestion in acid in
the way above pointed out, will require a much larger proportion
of oxalic acid, from twice to three times its weight; and
even then it will be greatly liable to precipitation after standing;
but when treated in the way described, it is not liable to precipitate,
but remains a permanent solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S<b>TEPHENS’</b></span>

<span class="smcap">I<b>NK.</b></span>—Stephens’ red ink is prepared as follows:—Take

<p>When the effervescence, arising from this combination, has
ceased, pour off the solution, or filter it from the insoluble matter;
to this, add by measure half the quantity of oxalate of

precipitated alumina or phosphate of alumina, in a damp state,
as much oxalic acid as will dissolve. Into this mixture, put,

give it a fine red color, varying the quantity according to the

of forty eight hours, strain it off for use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P<b>ROFESSOR</b></span>
 <span class="smcap">R<b>UNGE’S</b></span>
 <span class="smcap">W<b>RITING</b></span>
 <span class="smcap">F<b>LUID.</b></span>—One of the least ex­pen­sive
for­mu­las for the man­u­fac­ture of a writ­ing ink, is that
given by Professor Runge, who says: “I have
for some time <span class="xxpn" id="p372">{372}</span>
endeavored to find a black fluid possessing the properties of
forming no deposit, of adhering strongly to the paper, of being
unaffected by acids, and lastly, what is of great importance, not
acted upon by steel pens.</p>

<p>“After many experiments, I have succeeded in obtaining a
composition of the kind required, very simple in its preparation,
containing nothing but logwood, chromate of potash, and
water, and free from vinegar, gum, copperas, blue vitriol, and
even nutgalls. The low price of this writing fluid is also in
its favor. It is prepared by simply adding one part of chromate
of potash to 1000 parts of decoction of logwood, made by
boiling twenty-two pounds of logwood in a sufficient quantity
of water to give fourteen gallons of decoction; to this decoction,
when cold, the chromic salt is gradually added, and the mixture
well stirred. The addition of gum is injurious. In the
preparation of this ink, it must be remembered that the yellow
chromate and not the bi-carbonate of potash is employed, and
great care is required to ensure due adjustment of the relative
proportions of the ingredients used. The best way is to make
a decoction of logwood, and <i>gradually</i> add to it, well stirring
the mixture, as much solution of chromate as will give the
shade required.</p>

<p>“It appears astonishing what a small quantity of the chrome
salt is required to convert a large quantity of decoction of logwood
into a black writing fluid; the fact is however certain,
and care must be taken not to allow the proportion of chrome
salt to exceed half a part for each 500 parts of decoction of logwood,
as a larger quantity exercises a prejudicial effect in destroying
the coloring matter of the liquid, whilst in the proportion
above mentioned, a deep blue black writing ink is formed,
which, unlike the ink made with tannogallate of iron, is
perfectly fluid, forming no deposit. This writing fluid possesses
another advantage; the paper which has been written upon
with it may be washed with a sponge, or be left twenty-four
hours under water, without the writing being effaced. Weak
acids do not destroy the writing, nor do they
even change the <span class="xxpn" id="p373">{373}</span>
shade, whilst that made with gallnuts is effaced, and the ink
prepared with logwood and copperas is turned red.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>“New steel pens are coated with a greasy substance, which
prevents the ready flow of the ink; this should, therefore, be
removed previous to use by moistening the pens with saliva,
and then washing them in water. The application of an alkaline
solution is still preferable to remove this greasy matter.
The cleansing of the steel pens is absolutely essential in the
case of using the ink above mentioned. I have used this ink
upwards of two years, and my steel pens are not in the least
degree affected. No rust is formed on the pens, so that after
years of service the only wear experienced is that from constant
use on the paper, thus rendering unnecessary the use of
pens tipped with iridium and other hard substances.”</p>

<h3>ON THE GROWTH OF VARIOUS KINDS OF MOULD
IN SYRUP.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>Professor Balfour, the Professor of Botany in the University
of Edinburgh, has read a valuable paper on this subject, at the
Botanical Society in that city, in which he states that mould of
various kinds, when placed in syrup, has a tendency to spread
out and form a flat, gelatinous, and leathery expansion. This
he shows by experiments, as follows:—Mould that had grown
upon an apple was put into syrup; and in the course of two
months there was formed upon the syrup a cellular, flat, expanded
mass, while the syrup was converted into vinegar.</p>

<p>Mould that had grown upon a pear was also put into syrup,
and the same result was produced. He also experimented in
the same manner with various moulds that were growing upon
bread, tea, and some other vegetable
substances; the effect <span class="xxpn" id="p374">{374}</span>
produced, in most cases, was to cause a fermentation, resulting
in the production of vinegar. In another experiment, a quantity
of raw sugar, treacle, and water, were put into a jar, without
any mould being introduced. When examined, after a
lapse of four or five months, a growth like that of the vinegar
plant was visible, and vinegar was formed. This plant was removed,
and put into fresh syrup, which was followed again by
the production of vinegar. It appears that, when purified
white sugar only is used to make syrup, the plant, when placed
in it, does not produce vinegar so speedily; the length of time
required for the changes varying from four to six months.
Dr. Balfour thinks this may possibly be owing, to the presence
of some ingredient in the raw sugar and treacle, which may
tend to promote the production of vinegar.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>In connection with this subject, I may refer to the <i>Vinegar
Plant</i>, which is considered by some eminent botanists to be an
unnatural and peculiar form of some fungus. This plant, which
has a tough gelatinous consistence, when put into a mixture of
treacle, sugar and water, gives rise to an acetous fermentation.
The vinegar, which is the result of this acetous fermentation, is
of a syrupy nature; and when evaporated to dryness, a large
quantity of saccharine matter is left. Various conjectures have
been hazarded as to the origin of this vinegar plant; some
stating that it came from South America, or other distant regions;
and others that it is a spontaneous production. Dr.
Lindley is of opinion that it is a peculiar form of <i>penicillum
glaucum</i>, or common blue-mould. The general opinion appears
to be, that it is in an anomalous state of mould, or of some fungus:
and the peculiar form and consistence it assumes on different
occasions, seems to depend upon the nature of the material
in, or upon which, it makes its appearance.</p>

<h3>CONSTITUTION OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL
ASSOCIATION.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p><i>Whereas</i>, The advancement of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal knowledge and the
elevation of the professional character of apothecaries and druggists
throughout the United States are objects that are dear to us in
common with all well disposed phar­ma­ceu­tists; and, <i>whereas</i>, a large
portion of those in whose hands the practice of pharmacy now exists, are
not properly qualified for the responsible offices it involves, chiefly by
reason of the many difficulties that impede the acquirement of a correct
knowledge of their business;―</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, We, the members of a Convention now met at Philadelphia,
composed of apothecaries and druggists from different sections of
the Union, and from all the Colleges and Societies therein existing,
with the object of deliberating on the condition of our profession, <i>do</i>
hereby resolve and constitute ourselves into a permanent asociation,
to meet annually at such times and places as may hereafter be determined,
for more effectually accomplishing the objects for which we
are now assembled; and do now adopt the following

<h3>CODE OF ETHICS OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACEUTICAL
ASSOCIATION.</h3>
</div><!--section-->

<p>The American Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal As­soc­ia­tion, com­posed
 of Phar­ma­ceu­tists and Drug­gists through­out the Un­it­ed
 States, feeling a strong interest in the success and
 ad­vance­ment of their pro­fes­sion in its practical
 and scien­ti­fic rela­tions, and also impressed with
 the belief that no amount of know­ledge and skill
 will protect themselves and the public from the ill
 effects of an undue com­pe­ti­tion, and the temp­ta­tions
 to gain at the expense of quality, unless they are
 upheld by high moral obligations in the path of duty,
 have sub­scribed to the fol­low­ing <i>Code of Ethics</i> for
 the gov­ern­ment of their pro­fes­sion­al conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A<b>RT.</b></span> I. As the practice of pharmacy can only become uniform by
an open and candid intercourse being kept up between apothecaries
and druggists among themselves and each other, by the adoption of the
National Pharmacopœia as a guide in the preparation of officinal
medicines, by the discontinuance of secret formulæ and the practices
arising from a quackish spirit, and by an encouragement of that <i>esprit
du corps</i> which will prevent a resort to those disreputable practices
arising out of an injurious and wicked competition;—<i>Therefore</i>, the
members of this Association agree to uphold the use of the
Pharmacopœia in their practice; to cultivate brotherly feeling among the
members, and to discountenance quackery and dishonorable
competition in their business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A<b>RT.</b></span> II.
As labor should have its just reward, and as the skill,
knowledge and responsibility required in the practice of pharmacy
are great, the remuneration of the pharmaceutist’s services should be
proportioned to these, rather than to the market value of preparations
vended. The rate of charges will necessarily vary with geographical
position, municipal location, and other circumstances of a permanent
character, but a resort to intentional and unnecessary reduction in the
rate of charges among apothecaries, with a view to gaining at the
expense of their brethren, is strongly discountenanced by this
Association as productive of evil results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A<b>RT.</b></span> III.
The first duty of the apothecary, after duly preparing
himself for his profession, being to procure good drugs and prepartions,
(for without these his skill and knowledge are of small avail,) he
frequently has to rely on the good faith of the druggists
for their selection. <span class="xxpn" id="p379">{379}</span>
Those druggists whose knowledge, skill and integrity enable them to
conduct their business faithfully, should be encouraged, rather than
those who base their claims to patronage on the cheapness of their
articles solely. When accidentally or otherwise, a deteriorated, or
adulterated drug or medicine is sent to the apothecary, he should invariably
return it to the druggist, with a statement of its defects.
What is too frequently considered as a mere error of trade on the part
of the druggist becomes a <i>highly culpable</i> act when countenanced by
the apothecary; hence, when repetitions of such frauds occur, they
should be exposed for the benefit of the profession. A careful but
firm pursuit of this course would render well-disposed druggists more
careful, and deter the fraudulently inclined from a resort to their disreputable
practices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A<b>RT.</b></span> IV.
As the practice of pharmacy is quite distinct from the
practice of medicine, and has been found to flourish in proportion as
its practitioners have confined their attention to its requirements; and
as the conducting of the business of both professions by the same individual
involves pecuniary temptations which are often not compatible
with a conscientious discharge of duty; we consider that the members
of this Association should discountenance all such professional
amalgamation; and in conducting business at the counter, should
avoid prescribing for diseases when practicable, referring applicants
for medical advice to the physician. We hold it as unprofessional and
highly reprehensible for apothecaries to allow any per centage or commission
to physicians on their prescriptions, as unjust to the public,
and hurtful to the independence and self-respect of both parties concerned.
We also consider that the practice of some physicians, (in
places where good apothecaries are numerous) of obtaining medicines
at low prices from the latter, and selling them to their patients, is not
only unjust and unprofessional, but deserving the censure of all high-minded
medical men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A<b>RT.</b></span> V. The important influence exerted on the practice of pharmacy
by the large proportion of physicians who have resigned its
duties and emoluments to the apothecary, are reasons why he should
seek their favorable opinion and cultivate their friendship, by earnest
endeavors to furnish their patients with pure and well-prepared medicines.
As physicians are liable to commit errors in writing their prescriptions,
involving serious consequences to health
and reputation if <span class="xxpn" id="p380">{380}</span>
permitted to leave the shop, the apothecary should always, when he
deems an error has been made, consult the physician before proceeding;
yet in the delay which must necessarily occur, it is his duty,
when possible, to accomplish the interview without compromising the
reputation of the physician. On the other hand, when apothecaries commit
errors involving ill consequences, the physician, knowing the constant
liability to error, should feel bound to screen them from undue
censure, unless the result of a culpable negligence.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p><span class="smcap">A<b>RT.</b></span> VI.
As we owe a debt of gratitude to our predecessors for
the researches and observations which have so far advanced our scientific
art, we hold that every apothecary and druggist is bound to contribute
his mite towards the same fund, by noting the new ideas and
phenomena which may occur in the course of his business, and publishing
them, when of sufficient consequence, for the benefit of the
profession.</p>

<h3>VARIA—EDITORIAL.</h3>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<div class="divh4ord"><h4 class="h4runin">
THE JOURNAL.</h4>—With
the present number, the first volume of the Journal is
completed. In a pecuniary point of view its success has fully equalled the expectations
of its originators; it is no longer an experiment, but is established on a
firm basis, and will be continued with increased energy and a larger experience
in the art of journalism. We have tried to keep faithfully in view the objects
with which the Journal was commenced; while we have endeavored to present
to our readers whatever of general interest or importance has been published
abroad, we have the gratification to believe that some contributions to the general
stock have first appeared in our pages which would otherwise never have seen
the light. But those who confine the benefit of a journal solely to the information
it imparts have but a limited view of its usefulness; an account of what
is done abroad excites but little emulation compared with far humbler efforts
made by our own friends, and in our own neighborhood, and the encouragement
and promotion of such efforts is a large good, quite independent of the results
that may be attained. The mere attempt to write on a subject like scientific pharmacy
leads to a close scanning of the foundation of our opinions, to renewed experiments
to ascertain their justness, to more enlightened views of the connection and
bearing of our science. In this way we hope to see the
good done by the <span class="xxpn" id="p381">{381}</span>
Journal greatly increased. The contributors to its pages have hitherto been but few
in number, but its columns are open to all. They are controlled by no clique,
are subservient to no views of merely personal advancement, and we will gladly,
welcome communications from all quarters, judging of them only by their merit
and usefulness.</div>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<h4>THE DRUG INSPECTION LAW.</h4>

<p>We had intended to have made some remarks on the debate which took place
in the Convention regarding the admission of certain articles, under the law for
the inspection of imported drugs, which, though possessing medicinal properties
are, we believe, merely used for the purpose of adulterating other and better
articles, but willingly give place to the subjoined communication from Dr.
Guthrie, which, on the whole, advocates views similar to our own. With regard
to the Carthagena barks, as they are termed, we confess to a desire for further
information. Those barks vary very much from each other. Though not rich
in quinia, some of them contain a large per centage of alkaloids, which are closely
allied to it. We hope that the committee to whom the subject was referred
by the Convention will not only cause proper analyses to be made of the
commercial varieties of these barks, but will have experiments instituted regarding
their comparative therapeutic value. The Hospitals of our country afford
abundant cases of malarious disease, and, we have no doubt, the physicians attached
to them would be ready to institute trials which would afford a satisfactory
solution to this important question.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">G<b>EO.</b></span>
D. <span class="smcap">G<b>OGGESHALL</b>,</span></p>

<p><i>My Dear Sir</i>,—The proceedings of the National Phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal Convention
have just come to hand, and been perused by me, with no ordinary degree of
interest.</p>

<p>You have known somewhat of my anxiety concerning these preliminary and
forming stages of an Association of this character, and will readily believe that
I have awaited the results of the late Convention, from which, most unfortunately
for myself, I was compelled to be absent, with great solicitude. That solicitude
has been relieved, and in its stead I have the assurance that a good foundation
to a National structure has been laid, towards which hope points and
expectation looks with joyous anticipations of future good.</p>

<p>I may be permitted to congratulate you upon the successful labors of the convention,
and more especially upon the fact that you have avoided any untenable
false ground both in the convention and organization of the Association.</p>

<p>That old stumbling block of “all drugs good of their kind,” in reference to
our Drug Law, I see made its appearance again, but this time
from a quarter I <span class="xxpn" id="p382">{382}</span>
little expected. But it had, not­with­stand­ing its
new paternity and eminent godfathership,
only, so far as I can see, the same lame, diffuse and weak conclusions to
back it.</p>

<p>I was the more surprised at seeing the resolution in the form offered as coming
from my friend Dr. Stewart, of Baltimore, because I had considered him as one
who held entirely opposite opinions, and from this fact, that in a communication
made to me in January last, as special agent of the Treasury Department, charged
with the examination of the practical workings of the Drug Law, he says, “I
have inspected several hundred thousand dollars worth of one drug which requires
some particular notice, as I understand your views and mine correspond
with regard to it, and you have succeeded in arranging a uniform system of examination
at the different ports.</p>

<p>The prominent principles upon which its value is based vary from about one to
four per cent. The commercial article of the best varieties is graduated by the
quantity of valuable element above referred to, but with regard to the inferior
kinds this is not the case, as I have found upon repeated analyses that what are
called bastard varieties (which are not used for extracting the valuable principles
above referred to) <i>sell at</i> higher prices in proportion to their resemblance to
the <i>officinal kinds</i>. Even in cases where they contain no valuable medicinal
constituents they are invoiced at 3 to 4 times the price of the other varieties on
board the same vessel containing 3 per cent. Now if our object in this law is to
discourage the introduction of those articles that are used for the purpose of
adulterating medicines, it is manifest that the true interest of all will be served
by admitting those only of the bastard varieties that are <i>equal</i> to the inferior
officinal varieties, particularly as they happen to be at a lower cost and are very
abundant.” This is Dr. Stewart, Jan. 9, 1852. The whole of his report to me,
a very interesting and able document, I intend publishing, and have delayed it
for the purpose of accompanying it with some other matter of the same nature,
not yet in hand.</p>

<p>If I understand him correctly, he took entirely opposite ground in the Convention,
and I certainly shall look with no ordinary interest for some explanation of
a change so entire, in one whose position and well earned reputation give him
importance and great influence in the final settlement of this matter. What
new light has shone upon his path? What new facts has he to offer? I say
<i>final</i> settlement, because I see by the appointment of a committee to whom the
matter was referred, that the whole subject is but laid over. Although the convention
negatived the resolution, as it did a <i>similar</i> one a year ago in New York,
they seem disposed to endow the question with as many lives as are fabled of the
cat.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the reasoning of the author of the resolution, backed by
the eminent professor, and aided by other reasons, thick no doubt as blackberries,
you practical men who buy and sell these articles, were not convinced and
never will be. They may cry out for “tooth powder,” until the demand for
dentrifice shall quadruple, and tell us of the legitimate use of Carthagena or
Maracaibo barks; (what is its legitimate use?) all in vain,
for it is too well <span class="xxpn" id="p383">{383}</span>
known that the main use of the article is to adulterate the genuine barks. Why
does the Drug examiner at Baltimore, Dr. Stewart, say that the “bastard varieties
<i>sell at higher</i> prices in proportion to their
<i>resemblance to the officinal kinds</i>?”
Why this demand for such as resemble the genuine, but to supply it to the buyers
of Peruvian bark for the genuine and officinal. There can be no other conclusion.
If more proof is wanting I take the remark of the
gentleman from New-York,
that the “house he was connected with sold large quantities in powder,
and the parties purchasing did so knowing its origin.” No one could doubt this
statement, at least as to the quantity annually purchased, who will go through
half-a-dozen drug stores in any of the country villages or small towns any where
in our country from Maine to Louisiana.</p>

<p>He will have offered prime, best quality cinchona bark for 40 to 100 cents
almost any where, and in one half the cases the venders believe they are selling
what they offer, for they bought it for that. Is this not so, or is it all bought
for “tooth powder?” One half the druggists who go to our large cities, buy
“pale yellow” and red bark, and never think to enquire for the inferior barks,
and once drive these last from our seaboard cities, and we shall have done with
them.</p>

<p>You are aware that I have had some opportunity of becoming acquainted with
the drug trade of our country, and I assure you that throughout its length and
breadth there is more worthless Peruvian bark sold and consumed by far than
of the genuine, mostly, I hope through ignorance, but many times knowingly
on the part of the dealer.</p>

<p>The same that has been said of these false barks, may be said of English rhubarb;
when it is not sold for and in the place of Turkey, it is used to make powdered
Turkey out of. But the resolution does not stop short at these two
articles, as the discussion seemed to. There is “false jalap” undoubtedly good of
its kind, but unfortunately for the buyer the kind is good for nothing, although
it makes extract of jalap, that in looks cannot be told from the genuine.</p>

<p>There is also Egyptian opium, and a false Sarsaparilla and many other important
drugs, that should have received the attention of the friends of this resolution,
all of which, I beg to assure them, are undoubtedly good of their kind.</p>

<p>But I have written more than I designed by far, as the subject grows upon
my hands, though I regard it a very important one, and vitally so to the drug
law which lies at the very foundation of all beneficial results to grow out of this
association, and the position of the association as to the whole subject is equally
important, for if we unfortunately commit ourselves to a wrong principle in the
start, and especially upon this standard of purity as applicable to our Drug examiners,
which is now regarded as a test question by the community at large, we lose
all hold upon their confidence, and with it all hope of effecting any good either
to ourselves as a profession or to the community in general.</p>

<p>My chief object in addressing you this communication (intended for the New
York Journal of Pharmacy, if you choose so to use it) is to record my experience
as differing in toto from those of Dr. Stewart and Prof. Carson, and to elicit a
full discussion of the whole matter. Let us have light!
light! light enough to <span class="xxpn" id="p384">{384}</span>
settle this question, especially about the barks, for they are the source of this
whole contention after all. There must be data enough to be had, upon which
to form an opinion, and a correct one as to the medicinal virtues of Maracaibo,
and Carthagena barks, as well as of English rhubarb, false jalap, Egyptian opium
etc., etc.</p>

<div class="dkeeptogether">
<p>I shall be perfectly satisfied if the labors of this committee result in fixing a
definite standard of strength, or amount of alkaloids required to be found in
barks before consumed for medicine, and therefore admissible under the act, but
satisfied at nothing short of this, for till that is done there will never be any
uniformity in the action of the law. I had designed to make some remarks upon
the requirements of the law and its needed emendation which I must defer to
more leisure.</p>

<p>Introductory lectures are generally very common-place affairs. Custom has
prescribed that every year the different medical schools shall be opened with
them; and custom, too, has prescribed for them a certain limited range of topics.
Year after year, in a hundred places, the same round is gone over, and the same
good advice is listened to, and neglected. Dr. Bartlett has broken through all
this. He has chosen for the subject of his discourse the Character and Writings
of the Father of Medicine, and he has illustrated them well and thoroughly.
This is not the place for a detailed notice of the lecture. Yet we cannot but
call attention to the playful humour, the kindly and genial spirit which set off
and enliven its details, and which, breathing from the whole air and features of
the man, render him one of the most agreeable lecturers to whom we have ever
listened.</p>

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been generally retained, with some
exceptions noted below. Errata mentioned in the endmatter of monthly
issues have been ignored—left unchanged. Original printed
page numbers are shown like this: “{52}”.
Footnotes have been relabeled 1–30.
The commas used to end several
paragraphs by mistake, e.g. on page
<a href="#p176" title="go to p. 176">176,</a> were changed to full stops.
The transcriber produced the cover image and hereby assigns
it to the public domain. Original page images are available from
archive.org—search for “newyorkjournalof11852newy”.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Images were substituted for a few Unicode character
glyphs not widely available in reader apps: U261b, ☛; U2114, ℔; U2125,
℥; U0292, ʒ; U211e, ℞; and U2108, ℈. Ditto marks, including “Do” or
“do”, have been eliminated, replaced by repeated text. In a table on
page <a href="#p130" title="go to p. 130">130,</a> white space was
employed as a ditto mark. In this table, the white space ditto and
“Nitrici” have been replaced with “Acidi hydro nitrici”.</p>

eliminated. There were examples of this on pages 44 and

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
